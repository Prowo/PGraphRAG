First let's say this packaging is unbelievably beautifully with gorgeous dissolvable orchid petals in the serum. This is a hydrating balancing serum. It makes my skin feel very soft, it works well with my other skincare products and under makeup.<br />Now the ingredient list is a tiny bit disappointing when I look how far down some of the really fantastic ingredients actually are. The real reason I took off a star is because. I personally don't love putting alot of fragrance on my skin. Fragrance (parfum) is listed midway down. The scent I admit is lovely very floral. The scent lasts a long time. So I decided to use this on my decolletage (my chest area) I usually like to bring my skincare down into that area anyway. This way the strong yet beautiful floral scent is there but so is the skincare benefits. I recommend this if you don't mind putting alot off fragrance on your face. If it didn't contain so much fragrance I would have given this 5 stars and yelled \"GET IT\" from the roof tops, because it does make my face feel so soft!",

I saved all the serum to apply to my skin the next few nights. Yes this is a very good mask. About as good as a $10-$12 mask. Which is a tiny bit pricey for a single mask for the average person.

For this reviews sake I used this during the day under my makeup and it looked good. Now I use this at night. We expose our skin to alot of stresses in the environment and at night our skin rejuvenates. So I feel this is great to use while I sleep. This jar may seem small but a little goes a long way so it should last some time. It's not greasy, spreads across my face easily, and it absorbs well. It's very hydrating and it doesn't leave a shine on your face. I do use this sometimes during the day if I'm not wearing any makeup. (Like I said it looked good under makeup, I just don't use a separate moisturizer on makeup days I use a few other products and it'd be too much) Anyway when I wake up in the morning my skin really feels good. It's soft, smooth, and supple. It even has a bit more bounce back of you know what I mean. I'm impressed with this cream. It's fragrance free and doesn't irritate my skin which can be mildly sensitive. So I definitely can say I recommend it.",

Now this product does just what it says \"Tames your Main\", it will NOT make your hair poker straight. If that's what you're looking for then go to the salon. This does have a \"perm-ish\" smell to it that lingers a day or so, as does most perms, but it's not that bad. I left it on for the maximum time since my hair is resistant. It really cuts down on my styling time, and I don't have to go crazy with the flat iron. Maybe just a few swipes. It last on my hair about 2-3 months maybe more.

It works well- is very thick and gooey, so let it dry a minute or two between layers\u2026.but it works GREAT!! Especially for the price- is a steal!! The only complaint is That if tends to flake off easily, especially after active wear, within a few hours, and must be taken off completely and reapplied for best results when that occurs.

As other reviewers have noted it does take some practice to dispense the drops so they go in your eye and don't run down your cheek.  I've also used the Hylo-Forte drops which have double the amount of  Hyaluronic Acid (0.2% vs. 0.1%).  I prefer the latter for nighttime use since they're a bit thicker but both are good products and highly recommended.  The packaging claims there are 300 drops per container.  I haven't actually counted but it's probably fairly accurate - you do get an ample amount so the cost per drop isn't prohibitive.",

I did how soft it left my skin but at the same time my skin felt to Oily. The one reason I almost gave it a 4 was because I like how concentrated it was.

These guys don't use those silly clips to reinstall the head; they use magnets.....pure genius!! What took the razor industry so long to fix this problem??? I am a huge fan, and it gives a great shave.",

Since I\u2019m kind of allergic to chemical based sunscreen, my main go to is zinc based mineral products.  I go through a lot since I\u2019m on the water paddling, running or walking 7 days a week.  Since zinc is my go to, I\u2019ve leaned to live with just being white all the time (not my natural skin tone).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this sunscreen did not cause any allergies/ break out on my skin.  In addition, it went on so smoothly and left very little white cast.  There is a sort of mineral smell to it but I am fine with it and prefer it over fake coconut or perfume smells of other chemical based sunscreen products.  It\u2019s a nice consistency and very smooth.  Once rubbed in, I could hardly tell it was on.  It was not greasy or sticky.  I went out on an hour walk in 90 degree heat and then paddled the the next day for two and a half hours on and in the water wearing it and got zero burn.  The price is great too.  Very reasonable for a two pack of quality mineral based sun protection lotion.  It is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a sunscreen.  Of all the sunscreens I\u2019ve used recently, this one is my new favorite.  I will definitely repurchase when this two-pack runs out.",

                "text": "When I read the product page, it sounded like this foot cream had some of the same ingredients as some of my favorite lotions, so I thought it would help soften my rough, cracked feet. It wasn\u2019t until the package arrived that I saw what was REALLY in this product, and I was NOT pleased. However, I was willing to give it a try.<br /><br />Aside from the aloe, green tea leaf extract, water and coconut oil, many ingredients in this cream are kind gross or not helpful. The complete list is: urea, salicylic acid, deionized water, green tea leaf extract, coconut oil, dodecane, cetearyl alcohol, polysorbate 60, clyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, cetyl alcohol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, tea tree oil, glycerin, propylene glycol, carbomer, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerin caprylyl glycol, hexylene glycol, phenoxyethanol.<br /><br />The gross part is the main ingredient: 40% urea\u2014a major component of urine. Salicylic acid is used in wart-removing solutions because it exfoliates your skin. Dodecane is a chemical used in jet fuel which can cause skin, eye, and respiratory tract irritation. Alcohol dries out your skin. Xanthan gum is just a thickening agent made of corn. I am personally allergic to that and stearates. And the other chemicals are kind of sketchy, too.<br /><br />I tried this stuff on my feet for a couple of weeks, applying before I went to bed and wearing socks to protect my sheets. I really didn\u2019t see any significant change in the condition of my feet than when I apply regular alcohol-free lotion. It makes no sense to me that anyone would use this stuff so full of questionable chemicals, paying $27 for a little pot of this cream, when a regular bottle of lotion works just as good or better and goes for a fraction of the cost.",

Nor are there any warnings in the description or on the packaging to keep away from eyes, mouth, and lips and wash your hands thoroughly after applying. As effective as urea is and it's generally recognized as safe, there are some warnings about breast feeding as well.<br /><br />I know that urea and salicylic acid are excellent compounds for skin softening and can be used for things as serious as psoriasis, especially at that amount. I haven't used this for two weeks as I felt my warning was important, but I know it will be effective, having used urea/salicylic acid compounds in the past with great results of softening calluses and dry heels.<br /><br />If the correct ingredients were listed, I would give this a higher rating.

It's more closer to a vanilla scent but with a strong almost caramel-y tone to it, it reminds me far more of vanilla bean noel by bath and body works rather than most if not all cotton candy scents I've ever tried. Not a bad scent but for me I need my sweet Gourmond scents to be stronger than this and last much longer than 30 minutes to 1hr at best. If you love a quality sweet smell that's stand alone this might not be for you I think a 3.5 would be more fair it's close to a 4 but just not quite for those reasons. However I don't regret this buy I use it to top up other scents since it's nearly a brown sugar vanilla sort of caramel scent it goes well with most sweet scents (strawberry pound cake, Scarlett kiss, dark kiss, Oahu coconut, Hawaiian hibiscus etc) to intensify it but-- cannot really for me last alone if I rebought it it would be to use as that-- a topper scent. Also, not a bad scent for someone wanting a cheaper dupe for Eilish but again not as strong and not as lasting. So I'd bet a younger lady such as a teen or preteen would like this one vs myself who likes a sweetsie scent I just need it stronger, more longer lasting.",

Different lightings show different colors, sometimes red wine, sometimes brown, but not as purple.<br />Before I dyed my hair,  I had medium brownish color with Asian black on the roots,  and it was about three months after I used Prettia Provence Rose bubble hair dye. Prettia bubble hair dye is more gentle but doesn't last long compared to this one. You can see from the pictures. After a month, it's still with good color even though it has changed the color into lighter brownish red.<br /><br />Con<br />The only problem I found about this hair dye is that it's a strong bubble hair dye. The smell is fine for me, but if you accidentally leave it on your skin,  you might want to wash it out right away. It can stain on your skin very quickly. (I think that's the reason it last longer than Prettia.) However, you can always apply thicker lotion on your whole face, neck, and arms before you dye your hair. It can protect you from being exposed to the chemistry. Last note, if you have sensitive scalp or have wounds on your scalp, this hair dye might not be good for you.<br /><br />Beside the minor problems, I will still buy this again because I prefer long lasting bubble hair dye. Even though the chemistry is strong, it is not as strong as traditional hair dye. Hopefully, more colors are available.<br />Hope you find this review helpful!",

Wanted to try something different and after lots of searching, I came across this. I honestly wish I knew about this foam dye sooner because it was so easy to dye and also the box has gloves and a plastic cape.<br /><br />The solution was very easy to mix and at first, I was confused why the liquid wasn't foaming inside the bottle so I swirled it a bit more. But that was unnecessary as it comes out as foam from the dispenser. I have very long hair down to my lower back, and this bottle covered all of it and I still had some leftover.<br /><br />After leaving it on for 40 minutes (I didn't hear my 30-min timer), washed it with shampoo and the serum that comes from the box. I was left with a very nice reddish/purple color. The top half of my hair is my natural black and suprisingly it tinted that too. Very happy with the results and glad I bought a 2nd box.",

I used to hate the way old fashioned eyelash curler\u2019s gold or cremp lashes instead of curl unlike this tool they curve to the cutest wisky style lashes!\ud83e\udd70",

I have lashify diy eyelash extensions, and this curler is so much better than the lashify heated eyelash curler: Gets equally as hot and has the clip to hold your lashes. I sleep on my face and my eyelashes get pressed up straight up when I'm sleeping. When I wake up they look a hot-mess. The Lashify curler did not help me with this problem due to what I needed to do to fix my problem (no clip to hold lashes). I can first pull the lashes down at the base to have the correct angel again after waking up, and then once they are at the right angle coming off my eyes, I can curl the tops out of the straight mess they become when sleeping.<br />The whole device is made out of hard plastic including the tip. Holds my lashes well. $10 less than lashify curler too. Wish I had never purchased the lashify one now.<br />This product had good reviews until recently. It's been in my wishlist until this past week and when I purchased, I did not realize the reviews had gotten so bad. Not sure what is up with this.<br />It is true that you have to curl your lashes in segments with this curler, and can't to the full lash with one curl, so if that is what you are looking for, this is not the right choice for you.",

For example, I prefer wispy lashes and I\u2019d say each style is a variation of that \u2014 some are thicker, some longer, some are cat eye, but if you like one, you\u2019ll most likely be fine with the others. Usually these multi-style sets have too much variety, and I don\u2019t end up liking them all.<br /><br />In this set, you get 10 different styles of fluffy, wispy lashes, which I think are perfectly in the middle of being too natural looking and too fake looking lol. People might be able to tell you have fake lashes on bc they look too perfect and glamorous, but they aren\u2019t too \u201cover-the-top\u201d. Most of these can be worn during the day or for a night out, which I like. In my photo I am wearing the bottom left style, which you can see in my other photo.<br /><br />I had to cut off a little from the strip to fit my eye lid, which is typical with strip lashes. The band is thick and sturdy, so you can wash these with a gentle cleanser and wear them multiple times! I\u2019ll def be buying these again bc it\u2019s hard to find multi-style lash sets that I like.",

Perfect for when you want a more glam look and don\u2019t care if people might think you have fake lashes on lol.<br />The strip is very long, and they are cat eye style, so the lashes gradually gets longer towards the end of the strip. I had to cut off close to 1/4 inch, which is something I normally do with fake lashes. I cut from the longer end, and they still looked plenty long (see photo). The band is also very thick, so if you are careful with them and use a gentle wash, you can get several wears out of each strip!",

The bangs are a little short for my liking, but that's a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />My one and only complaint is that at the crown, the stitches show. I have to spend a minute or so each morning brushing it just so in order to cover that little spiral. Hiding it is possible, but it takes time.

Even if you get a little bit in your eye, it doesn\u2019t burn.<br /><br />Taking care of my skin, especially my face is very important, and I do not want to put anything carcinogenic or harmful on my skin. This cleanser checked all the \u201cexcellent\u201d boxes for me, ingredient-wise.  And, generous portion for the price, it will last a long time with the handy pump action bottle. I\u2019ve already gone through one bottle, but it took a long time. These days, with so many big corporations and wanting to spend my hard earned money more wisely, I also really like that this business is women owned. Who else can make a product for women as good and as thoughtful as this one than other women. Love it!",

I tried so many different toners including Celimax Noni Toner. But this one\u2026 it\u2019s a top notch product for my super dry skin!!<br /><br />It moisturizes my skin soo good without drying out. To me it\u2019s not heavy at all but it\u2019s not too light either which I prefer. It\u2019s probably in between.<br /><br />It plumps and hydrates my skin all day,  my large pores which were a big part of my concern for years got shrunk, it soothes my skin, and I rarely have hormonal acne since I started to use it. It\u2019s so perfect for me and I feel like finally found a right one!! Hydration is the key to shrink pores and plump which make you look youthful!!<br /><br />Noni toner is more popular than this one from the same company but for me this Sedum essence wins!! Plus Noni cream with the sedum essence seems working really well to shrink my large pores!<br /><br />My favorite skincare routine\u25bc<br /><br />Make p:rem milk Cleaning<br />Anua heartleaf toner (2 layers)<br />Celimax Real Sedum Essence (3 layers)<br />Ample N Ceramide Shot Ampoule<br />Celimax Noni Cream",

(1) yes, it will activate the peeling of a layer or two, and usually with in a couple of days, (2) product design is a bit cumbersome to use (a plastic bag bootie that has the ooze inside that is a bit of a struggle to get on your foot, and (3) because the goo inside is all over the plastic bootie, it not only gets on the bottom of your feet, but all over your entire foot (bottom, top, ankle, etc.).  As a result of #3, not only did my entire foot feel tight and tingly for days, but the product created a very irritable rash on the tops of my feet. The rash has been there all week and still hasn't subsided.  This would be a much better product if you could just put it on the bottoms of your feet or where the dry/calloused skin is.  If I every use it again, I will put it on a plastic mat or something and just allow the bottoms of my feet to be exposed to the goo or rub it on the needed areas with a plastic glove.  NEVER again will I put it on as a sock/bootie and now I just hope the tops of my feet heal.

                "text": "I've used several different shampoo bars to help reduce the plastic waste in my household. I have long plain hair, usually in a pony tail and I never blow dry, let alone straighten or curl. My point is that I don't really expect much from my shampoo beyond cleansing. But this B.O.B bar kinda blew my mind. The first time I used this bar, my hair was very very dirty with excise sweat and DAYS of dry shampoo buildup. I was totally expecting to wash twice for a complete cleanse. But after the first rinse, my hair felt really clean AND moisturized. I typically apply conditioner to the bottom half of my hair, I Rarely skip this step because my hair usually feels a bit roughed up from the shampoo. Again, I have long hair and I wash maybe twice a week. For the first time EVER, my hair felt plenty moisturized after just one wash with the B.O.B bar, so I skipped the conditioner.<br />My Hair dried SO BEAUTIFULLY. Its soft and has volume. I didn't even need to run a brush through it. I gave up on these type of results a long time ago, especially after transitioning from bottles to bars. All I really came to expect was clean hair. But the BOB bar far exceeded my expectations. I purchased the Purify Bar.<br />And its a good value. Its frustrating to see bars so expensive, how does anyone expect the average woman to do away with the plastic when they can buy like 4 bottles of shampoo from the grocery store for the cost of 1 bar?<br />Anyway, I 100% recommend this product. Thank You B.O.B &lt;3",

I'm not a fan of the strong scent but it doesn't linger once its dry so I can deal with it. It just smells really strong like essential oils or something. But it did such a good job on my hair that its not a deal breaker. I'm also really sensitive to scents, way more than the average person, so it probably won't bother most people. And it didn't irritate my skin or cause hives like most fragrances do. This is the best shampoo I've tried for my typically oily, flat, dull hair. It looks better than its looked in years.",

I have issues with my hair being really oily by the end of the day and I've been looking for something that gets rid of the oiliness without stripping my hair and causing a ton of breakage. This is the first one that has accomplished that, and I have tried a lot of different shampoos and conditioners in this price range. I was starting to think I wouldn't be able to find anything. The conditioner bar was easy to apply and it was very good at detangling. My hair is very fragile so if it gets a lot of knots in it, that always results in breakage. That did not happen with this conditioner. It left my hair shiny, soft and light, not weighed down with residue at all. I am going to stick with this one because its the best I've tried.",

The shampoo smells more like orange and the conditioner smells more like chocolate. It is not overpowering and does not smell like someone sprayed perfume in my hair after its rinsed out. There is just a very subtle scent that my sensitive husband does not even notice. I hope this available for awhile, but if not I will be trying their other products.",

I made the switch to this bar shampoo a month ago. I use the purifying bar, it is kinda small but pretty thick. I wanted to test the product for a decent amount of time and see if there were any noticeable changes, and there have been! I was a little confused the first attempt, I couldn\u2019t get the bar to lather properly but by the second wash I had it down. The bar has a very light scent on my hair, the bar itself doesnt smell amazing but I dont care about that.  I noticed immediately that when my hair was dried it was incredibly soft, softer than with anything I've used before. I have also noticed that my build up is MUCH slower to come back, i went from having to wash my hair every other day to twice a week max! Very happy about that. There is no waxy feeling left on my hands or hair either. Overall very happy with this purchase, and i\u2019ll be coming back for more when I run out (: I encourage  anyone thinking of making the switch.",

It kept my hair from getting oily between washes for up to 3 days (craziness) and kept it soft and lovely. The only downside to this shampoo bar is that it's different from other shampoos I've used in that it's SUPER difficult to brush your hair out while moist after using it in the shower. I recommend a leave in conditioning cream to help with that, I always have to use it to brush my hair out after a shower with this soap without breakage. Will def buy again!",

The only problem I have is that the prices of BOB bars went from $9.99 to $19.99 which has completely gone out of my budget for essentials, so had to move to a different company (bottles). If you can afford it go for it, but I feel that you might as well just go back to using bottles again if they do the exact same thing as this product.

Please don't stop manufacturing these!!<br /><br />Review for: 360\u00b0 DOG TOOTHBRUSH SLIM VERSION (Blue Box)<br />Use: 11lb. Senior Age Rat Terrier Chihuahua with highly sensitive gums and very yellow teeth.<br /><br />My husband and I have searched high and low for 360 toothbrush to use on our little puppo since buying one while we were on our trip to Japan and was SO SO HAPPY to find this on Amazon! Our puppo's gums bleed very easily, she hates getting her teeth brushed and we needed a toothbrush that 1. Had narrower cylinder to brush her teeth more effectively and 2. Was soft and wouldn't irritate her gums.<br /><br />This 360\u00b0 SLIM TOOTHBRUSH brush, worked well. She doesn't mind it as badly as when we used the other competing toothbrushes but it was definitely a little bit more firm than the YELLOW SOFT TOOTHBRUSH made by this same company. There was some pink blood here and there but definitely not as bad as other toothbrushes we've used from other companies.<br />It was gentle still but firm enough to clean her teeth and the fact that it was 360\u00b0 made it easier to clean her teeth.<br /><br />As I said in my other reviews, we are looking forward to a cleaner bill of health for our sweet older puppo with these brushes! Please do not stop making these/selling these on here! The prices are very fair for $6.50~$7.00 per toothbrush considering these are imported!!",

However, they seem to work/adhere best when the liner is still wet or they just dont seem to cling after the liner has been opened a couple times. I rolled mine instead of shaking to prevent air from being mixed (if its anything like polish). They definitely need to be washed between uses or if you want to remove them and realign the lash after it dries as it blocks the magnets. As far as comparing to other magnetic lashes, this is my first pair. If you compare them to other lashes with glue I would say it's fairly equal. If the glue lashes have the same application I dont see why those wouldnt do just as well. I expected to be able to remove the lashes and readjust as needed like taking a magnet off a fridge and reapplying. Not the case at all unless I'm somehow doing it wrong. Also, you cant really trim these down on the strips cuz it's not a magnet the entire strip, just a few spots. If you cut the strip the magnet could be cut off as well and wont lay flat on your eye.",

The weft is a nice hair thinkness about halfway down, then it becomes thin. Upon testing the manageability of the hair, I found it to be very dry and kincky, like really kinky. It loses the luster and curlyness of the hair. It would take a great deal of time getting it to resemble a look that you would want to show to the world. I've purchased synthetic and 100% human hair weave many time from various vendors on Amazon Prime. This is the worst I have ever ordeed. It was quite easy to arange the return and refund for this item. UPS dropped off the label, I repacked the item in the original box, labeled it and left it for pick up / next business day at the front sesk as per instructed by Amazon Prime. Beautiful color, but that is where it ends.",

                "text": "Not sure if I really want to post a photo of the wax with all my armpit hair on it, but this was absolutely so easy to work with. I would definitely recommend this as it managed to get almost all the hairs minus a few stragglers, which compared to the other wax i used was 98% less hairs I'd be left needing to pluck after waxing. Crazy how much less wax I needed to get it all too.<br /><br />A few things I noticed was that it was much harder to try and peel off thinner layers of wax if you applied it too thin. Also if you applied it too thick, it would be sticky to touch and sometimes harder to pull off with my nail extension unless it was fully cooled which I didn't have the patience for, honestly. I kind of had to rush so there was that as well.<br /><br />Additionally, I know with waxing it sometimes takes a layer of skin off, now I'm not sure if what I experienced was the thin wax needing to be peeled off, or just a LOT of surface skin that was peeling. It didn't hurt to pull that \"skin\" off nor did it burn when I applied some ingrown hair oil and the cooling post shave balm from Nivea, but time will tell. I'm no professional by any means, BUT it was one of the best self waxes I've done aside from the old waxing strips that aren't made the same anymore from Veet (in the pink box, the old wax that was good was like a yellowy-orange-brown color. The new pink wax doesn't do much other than make my underarms horrifyingly sticky unless I bathed it in baby oil and soapy water and pull... yeah, was never easy or fond of those strips after those attempts)<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely use this wax again every time as it was much easier to tolerate as it didn't really even have a scent either! My old wax had this particular smell that was always just ... not natural and I didn't get that at all with this wax. There was a mild scent when you open the bag but once the beads heat up I did not notice any at all, and if there was a scent, it was no where near as noticeable in my room whatsoever like my old wax beads.",

It also came with ear plugs and a travel bag.<br /><br />It was easy to plug up and get started, the package arrived in was small and well put together like a kit.<br /><br />This would be a nice gift for someone who may just enjoy having something nice to sleep with.<br /><br />The only thing that concerns me is I have to be careful not to fall asleep with it on because of the USB cord that must remain attached to it in order for it to be hot. You can however disconnect it and sleep with it just as a regular mask.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with this product!<br /><br />Q. Would I buy this again?<br />A. Yes!",

I do see that other reviewers had the same problem, though I am choosing not to lower my star rating, as the package arrived on a particularly hot day this summer, so I was kind of expecting them to be melted even before I opened the package.<br /><br />Once I got the single large chunk of wax out of the bag, I managed to cut it with a sturdy chef\u2019s knife, resulting in me now having a number of large chunks of wax, and each of those chunks easily fits in the wax melting device. They don\u2019t take much longer to melt in this larger block form, compared to how they would have melted in the smaller beans form, and they do melt fine and the result is the same. The wax has a familiar hair removal wax scent, smells similar to other waxes; it is not a strong odor. I warmed the wax to a honey-like consistency, and the wax then works just as well as any other wax, it is very effective, and feels comfortable on the skin. It is effective at removing course and fine hairs. Again, I would have much preferred this to have arrived in the unmelted bean form but I do think it was likely due to the hot weather. This is good wax. I like it.",

But I\u2019m glad I tried because I can\u2019t go back any smaller now, haha. These are lightweight, soft, and last through my whole shift with the black Duo lash glue. However, out of the three sets, 6 lashes total, I only got 5 of them. :( The one in the middle was just missing for some reason. Bummer because each set is unique, so I can\u2019t just mix and match with the other two. So that sucks. Oh well, that\u2019s just an error and the quality is very good! Five stars, anyways.",

Just file off as usual, apply this like polish and let it sit for less than 10 minutes. It starts to bubble and comes right off with minimal effort. Now because I use 5 ish layers of gel it sometimes takes a few applications and the base coat sometimes will only come off in patches, however light buffing will fix that.<br /><br />I am so glad I found this product because I now can wear my gels without fear of removal.",

My manicure lasted over 20 days and then finally began to chip. Which is where this product comes in. So I was skeptical but figured it was worth the $6 risk. It was extremely thick and gummy consistency which made it hard to paint on my nails. But after painted on and waiting a little (30 seconds maybe?) my nails began to tingle which kind of freaked me out. The thing about this product is that if you have a really good gel manicure with a lot of layers then this is a process. You have to wait 5 minutes then scrape off a layer then re-apply until you got all the layers. So it works, just not a quick process. So depending on your time, it might just be easier to go to the salon.",

It took a few times to get the right brightness level and it's not an exact match, but I'm happy with the outcome color. It's worth noting though that it took a lot of lightening to get it right. I needed very little plum to create the color.<br /><br />The picture is first week after dying, color only on top of non-treated, non-bleached hair. The difference between back and front is a function of color depositing on grey, an effect I like because it gives some variation and highlighting effects.

It does leave my mouth feeling incredibly clean and I much prefer this to using old-fashioned floss. The different attachment heads are very easy to switch out. The only thing I'm not crazy about is there is really no way to clean/dry the water reservoir between uses.

Of the heatless methods, this product is my preferred go-to, though I still haven't mastered it. My experience with this product does not impact my review - my score is based on the overall use of the product itself.<br /><br />Material;<br />Hair health is important especially when it comes to styling.<br />The rod and hair ties are silk which is a definite plus. However, for the health of your hair, you are sacrificing ease. The softness of silk creates slippage and combined with the length of the rod this causes difficulty when prepping the hair.<br /><br />I am not complaining about the material itself - just stating it would be nice to have a way to ensure the product stays in place during prep.<br /><br />Supplies;<br />The clip meant to hold the rod in place while prepping isn't my favorite, but this is due to personal comfort rather than a mark against the product. It just feels like it's pulling at my hair rather than holding things in place. For those who may have a similar experience, I suggest having other types of clips handy.<br /><br />The rod itself is really long, which can be beneficial to ensure all of your hair can be wrapped. However, this length gets in the way. Securing the wrapped hair proves difficult with the amount of material you have to move the hair ties over. Wearing this product during the day is going to be awkward with any sort of head movement. With that being said, the rod itself is comfortable to wear, even while sleeping. I just wish there was extra fabric at the ends to allow for tying the rod out of the way.<br /><br />Use;<br />Lastly the instructions are basic, so I suggest the use of tutorials to find what best works for you. Some things to consider for first-timers;<br />- Do not use wet hair. Damp to dry works best.<br /><br />- Use some sort of product to help your hair keep shape, especially if it's heavy.<br /><br />- There is a learning curve. Don't give up if you don't get it right the first few times. I'm still struggling to find the best way to achieve the look I want.<br /><br />With my points in mind, I do recommend this product for those seeking heatless curls. The product itself is not bad - it just takes some practice to get used to.",

It went on really smooth and creamy and did not burn like some lip stains I have used in the past.  I wore it around the house, through a workout, eating dinner and drinking and by the end of the night the only wear that I could see was right in the center of my lips. I did notice that after a couple hours my lips were a little dry so a hydrator to accompany the color might be a great option.

I find that it works best when using a light mist of water from a spray bottle and a texturizing spray.<br /><br />It\u2019s somewhat easy to use, but because it\u2019s made of a silky material, it tends to slide around on my head and not stay in place.<br />The outside silky liner loosens, twists and loses its original shape after using it. I have a soft cotton one by another brand that works better, so in comparison, this one isn\u2019t as good. It also doesn\u2019t come with a headband to help keep hair wrapped and secure. It\u2019s a bulkier wrap and leaves the top strands of hair looser which can cause the curls to not be as defined as they could be.<br /><br />I started by putting the wrap at the top of my head, claw clipped it in place and moved strands of hair from the back of my head, underneath to the front and combined it with strands from the front, then continued to wrap the strands of hair around the wrap. I repeated this on each side until I was done. I used the hair ties at the ends to secure my hair in place. Getting strands of hair from the back to the front in sections can be a little complicated. With practice, it gets easier.<br /><br />I let it sit in my hair overnight, it worked as described but left wavy/ loose curls rather than tight curls.

It pulled my hair, didn't get hot enough, and was just not up to the standards of my initial Chi. My hair dresser has L'ange straightener and was a previous Chi owner, as well. I decided to give this straightener a try and I could not be more impressed. I have had it a week and have already fallen in love with it. It heats up quickly, allows for heat control, shuts off after 1 hour of being on, leave my hair smooth and shiny, and doesn't pull it out while straightening! My hair is also holding the style throughout the day, which I also had difficulty with during the day. This is a great tool for getting your hair pin straight or going for the beachy waves/curls!",

I\u2019m giving 3 stars because it was shipped fast, and does heat up incredibly fast. It does go to 450 like it says. What I\u2019m bummed about it that there is a constant clicking in the unit, and I can\u2019t figure out what it\u2019s coming from. I would say this is not best for color treated hair, as it is melting the color off of my hair and the straightener is covered in brown/black gunk after I\u2019m done using it. It also pulls my hair when straightening, and doesn\u2019t just glide right through it like cheaper straighteners I\u2019ve purchased. Super bummed it\u2019s not as great as I had hoped for :(",

Never thought I would like doing this as much as a I do. The color is pretty dark so I may get the shade lighter next time. Will be purchasing this again and again. Thanks!",

However, I found a few that basically matched my natural brow shape, with one in particular as my fave. I have used the stencils for my fave shape twice, and they aren't very stick anymore. Therefore, the issue is, once they won't stick at all, I will have to alter my natural brow shape to accommodate another stencil that I like. I will add that doing brows used to take as long as the rest of my face, and this literally takes 90 seconds, and boom baby!",

This is better than a curling iron, doesn't break your hair or burn it. Is easy breezy to do and hair look fabulous. I use it both when Im wearing my natural curly hair to give more definition to my natural curls on the front, and with blowdry straight hair to give some nice loose wave that create texture and movement. Super easy to use and in 5 minutes I can curl all my hair if needed. This is one of the best hair products I have bought and I hope the last forever.",

They are a great quality lash for a very reasonable price.<br /><br />The lash band isn\u2019t too thick so that it\u2019s uncomfortable, or too thin that you can\u2019t work with them. The lash band is sturdy, yet flexible. Very comfortable to wear on the eyes<br /><br />The actual lashes themselves are fluffy & multidimensional. They are full, yet give good separation & length. They blend nicely with your natural lashes. Highly recommend",

You\u2019re not compromising comfort for style either.<br /><br />You get 2 styles of lash, a more tapered lash that\u2019s shorter towards the inner corner & gets longer towards the outer edge. You also get a style that is more the same length but adds so much volume to your lashes. I recommend stacking them together to get the best of both worlds<br /><br />The value for the $$ was great since you get 2 styles of lashes. 8 pairs of each for a total of 16 pairs.<br /><br />Highly recommend!!",

I haven\u2019t managed to reuse these because they crumple when I remove them from my eye.  So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the best bang for your buck if you\u2019ve already got tweezers and lash adhesive and eye makeup remover.  But if this is your first kit or you\u2019re a beginner \u201ceyelash wearer\u201d then I think this kit is great.

                "text": "I first learned about this sunscreen from No BS Beauty (a no-nonsense, non-sponsored skincare enthusiast on YouTube). I was looking for something with good staying power, good filters (beyond FDA archaic limits), and no scent/fragrance for both everyday and outdoor activity sun exposure.  This hits all the marks. I have maturing skin (almost 50), and use tret, so UV exposure protection is a must. I've repurchased this one throughout the year (2022). It has never failed me: long, multi-hour summer hikes, summer outdoor wedding, and now, just as an SPF make-up primer for everyday life (work, errands, etc). I would say it does leave a slight white cast on my medium-olive skin tone, but that disappears with my sheer BB cream or foundation. It leaves a not-quite matte, smooth/silky, almost powdery finish that I appreciate because, having maturing combo-skin, I cannot stand all those highly praised \"dewy\" sunscreens that make me look greasy moreso than \"dewy.\"  If you're seeking \"dewy,\" this isn't it. I wouldn't say it's matte or drying either -- it just hits the sweet spot for me. I am a bit of a skincare nerd who wants to try out lots of different sunscreens, and I have no doubt there are amazing alternatives out there, but when you find something that works? At least in my case, I end the hunt and just hit re-order. Make sure you check the seller's storefront and ratings (always recommend that when purchasing J or Kbeauty skincare products from Amazon). This one is definitely worth trying and adding to your collection!",

                "text": "Needless to say i have xp with hair removal.  I was never really a super hairy but loved the feeling of being totally hairless from head to toe.<br /><br />With all the sessions and hrs i barley have any hair but do have some spots on thighs, arms and other spots, that are fairly light even with all the professional laser treatments and electrolysis.  IPL aka this device is NOT the go-to treatment for hair reduction but it does work.<br /><br />Firstly, you need to use an electric razor or standard razor on the areas your zapping.  Freshly showered, no oils or lotions on skin.  If you dont feel heat your not killing hair follicles.  The laser targets the pigment in the hair and absorbs the heat, so as they stated vampire skin, dark hair gets the best results.<br /><br />If you have never gotten any sort of  pro hair removal your hair is going to be fuller and courser.  Like the subject heading states, ive had 28 full body laser hair removal treatments aka real hair removal that leaves you with red bumps, plus hrs of electrolysis and I still have hair grow back.<br /><br />People it takes a long time to remove hair!  This is not designed to be a one zap and the hair is gone.  It will grow back finer and weaker, until it eventually is killed off.  It literally takes years.<br /><br />I zap each spot 5 times on the highest setting.  The heat will build on each subsequent zap, meaning im actually hitting follicles.  I would not recommend this if you have course hair or never had pro hair removal - build up to that, but this device is a nice supplement to the pro hair removal.  It will never replace it and will take longer. For me its perfect and thats why i gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />Once you zap the hair you should see a reaction, raised bumps, some redness, along the bikini line for example its very noticeable since the hair is courser - that means its working.  It takes about 10 -14 days for the zapped hair to push its way out.  Its not instant, the hair still remains in the follicle.  You can expedite this by lightly exfoliating in the bath or shower.  You may see little black spots in the follicle where the hair has been zapped and effectively targeted.<br /><br />Hair grows in cycles, doing this every week is pointless, if the hair is not in the growth phase you cant kill it. Every 4 weeks, multiple zaps per spot and the hair WILL fall out and come back weaker.  Different areas have different growth cycles but 4 weeks is a good middle ground.<br /><br />  This is used for hair reduction.  If you want permanent (still takes multiple treatments( you need electrolysis.<br /><br />If you want faster hair reduction result you need to use laser only found at the dermatologist or reputable laser spa.  IPL is not laser treatment. This is not going to ever replace that.  A combination of all three over 3 or 4  years will leave you hairless, so keep your expectations realistic.",

Back in the day it was way too expensive for a single mom to go to laser treatment which was the ONLY option.  I even had one girl call me out on my dark chin (I plucked but had the shadow by 5pm). Then, they came out with the at home devices but they were $359 on shopping channels and generated poor reviews. So, no luck there. By accident I ran across this having no clue they were now very affordable.  I couldn't believe it. Now, it's mine and after ONE treatment I already have a bald spot on my upper lip which makes no sense after my first try! THANK YOU for helping me regain some self-confidence. Plus, I NEVER leave reviews due to time constraints-but just had to come here and tell my struggle for so many years.",

It stretches very easily but still very effective in holding her hair back. It's the perfect size for that kind of in between phase she's in right now. The fabric is very soft, it's not going to break my daughter's hair. I really like the assortment of colors and how many you get for the price. Especially for a 3-year-old, it's hard enough keeping her accessories all in one place. So for the price and what you get this is a great value.",

Now that Im 40 it caught up. I had shaved my head for some medical stuff last year and when it grew back it was 40% grey. Yikes. So I really wanted a smokey blonde to combat the excess grey that grew in.<br /><br />Results: when I dyed my naturally 5A and White (40% greys) I got an orangey ombre type look on my new virgin natural hair. I then decided to wait a couple weeks, bleach it with the Hyper Platinum Feria lift and ended up with a silvery ash blonde / light ash brown highlighted effect like on the box.<br /><br />Not sure how long before the stage coach turns into a pumpkin and the color fades and the greys come through and I look like I'm 80 - but for now I'm happy. At least it grew back!<br /><br />You must use this on bleached or very light hair. It will turn a 5 level brown brassy, so keep that in mind. You'll need to bleach if you're that dark to get the look on the box. It works quite well if you mind the directions or bleach first.",

That is a big misclaimer.  We left it on for over 30 minutes and saw nothing of the sort... no dark colored spots rose to the surface.  It did make our skin feel moisturized and smooth that lasted about a half of a day.  Not nothing like what it said it should do.  I would not spend a dime on this.",

That said,  I don't have acne or other major skin issues. I bought this product to see if it would help with mild greasy pores, which I assume is quite normal. No noticeable change.<br /><br />For me It did irritate the skin where the skin is most sensitive or thin. Specifically, I felt burning & had small patches of redness in and around my nose. If you buy this product I recommend keeping it away from areas of thin skin like nose, eyelids, etc.<br /><br />From a value for money perspective, this product is meh! Doesn't help beyond soap and water. My kids do get a kick out of the green face...so maybe it is a better entertainment product than a beauty product!",

I am giving this wig two stars since it is a wig and there is hair attached to it. You get the wig, some brushes, and two head nets that look more like a tiny footie nylon. I could not get it to stay on my head though I tried several times. The wig is supposed to be 16 inches but it much shorter than that. The thing was very smelly - not quite sure what the smell was but I did not like it! I have ordered many wigs and they are all fun and even though they aren't real hair they all looked better than this one. Maybe if you wash it, cut it, style it, it might be okay. I brushed it and trust me, that did not help out at all! At a price point of over $100 I do not recommend this wig for anything! So sorry. Real hair or not - it is a NO WAY from me!",

Well, you be the judge! I have long hair so it might be hard to tell but I think it looks pretty realistic! I don't have a wig hair net yet, so I had to improvise. But I think you get the idea! There is no part, you just kind of muss it up! I will update with a picture after I purchase a wig skull hat. I think the wig will lay much nice then! So, I think it's cute! 5 Stars!

I am by no means professional, but as 35 years old and doing makeup every day keeping up with trends I have used my fair share of brushes and so far the variety and quality for the price are the nest I have used!

If you\u2019re in need of a shampoo that has little to no scent then you may love this shampoo. I will keep it and use it, but I don\u2019t think I will buy it again.

                "text": "I have been searching for a really good mascara for a little while now. I have always been a fan of Maybelline's Colossal mascara, but they decided to change up the formula a while back and it's just not the same, especially the waterproof one.<br /><br />Decided to give this one a shot and here is what I have found so far:<br /><br />1. It's definitely not waterproof, so if you have any kind of allergies and watery eyes, beware, it will smudge all over the place.<br />2. It applies nicely. Gives even coverage on the lashes without weighing them down with too much product. I would say it is mostly true to the name of length and lift as it does do both, just don't be expecting to look like you have false lashes on.<br />3. The wand brush is a little more streamlined compared to that of the Colossal, which I think helps with the lifting and lengthening. Depending on how you like your lashes to look, a coat or two with this and you're good to go.<br />4. Durability - here is where I had somewhat of an issue. I apply my makeup in the morning before work (even with working from home I never know when I will have an impromptu video call, so I'm always prepared). This usually occurs shortly before 7am and I need my makeup to last me ALL DAY because I usually don't get around to washing it off until 10-11pm. What I have found with the Almay is that even though it goes on nice and evenly, half way through my day I start to find my lashes feeling weighed down and notice they start clumping together. I thought it was odd, so decided to try again the next day to see what happened and sure enough, same thing. I don't know if it's just due to the formula or what but that has been my experience.<br />5. Washes off very easily. I use coconut oil to remove my makeup and then use my cleanser to completely wash my face and I haven't had any issues with removal.<br /><br />Since I do actually like the product aside from it's durability, I've decided to play around with it and see if I can get it to wear a little better. What I've been experimenting with is applying this first to add length and then apply my waterproof mascara to sort of set them both (and so it gives me the waterproof protection I need) and it seems to be holding up when used this way. Can't say what the real issue is with why this doesn't wear well all day.. is it me or is it the product itself..who knows? I don't hate it at all, just wish it would wear better.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",

I has a fresh spicy/peppery punch and slowly transforms into a nice mild blend of pepper, musk and vanilla.<br />First time wearing it and people were pleasantly surprised/intrigued by this fragrance. All in all I do not regret this purchase and would happily buy again !",

So heavy that when trying to stand the brush up in a bowl to soak prior to use, it keeps falling over and spilling the bowl over too.",

                "text": "I'm just getting back into using a safety razor after decades of using a multiblade cartridge razor and/or really high end electric shavers, and I'm very happy with this kit.  Functionality wise, is just excellent. It's easy to switch out blades, nice weight to it, nice grip.  I also really like the brush and stand and the look of the whole set displayed in my bathroom. It's great when a razor works well, but it's even better when it looks great for the 23.5 hours per day that you're not using it.<br /><br />The blades that come with the set seem decent, but I also ordered a 15 brand 2-blade variety pack, and will be going through each of these brands to find the one(s) I like the most.<br /><br />If you're just getting back into safety razor shaving like me or if you're doing this for the first time, hang in there. Watching a few YouTube videos will help you. Most importantly, do not treat this like a multi-blade, lubricated cartridge razor. Safety razors are one-pass razors, do not apply pressure, and don't shy away from pre/after shaving skin/beard conditioners, lotions, etc.  When you do everything right, this single blade will give you the best, closest shave you've ever had.",

I was just over dyeing my hair and didn\u2019t want to keep wearing an Afro, so I decided to have it twisted with this hair. My hair is really curly so I had to use a sticky gel like she I bomb or just for locks twist gel so my ends would lay down and blend with the hair and I also used hair jewelry to keep things in place. Overall I\u2019m satisfied because I\u2019m able to keep my hands out of my head for a few weeks, and just let it grow. I only used 3 bulks of hair for this style and I bought two bags each bag came with six bulks so I have plenty left to do this again so I can let my hair grow out. Hope this helps.",

The shampoo lathers up nicely and the conditioner tames the tangles.

This gel is a bit closer to a lotion in viscosity but would still work on a warm evening. However, it smells like a bar of basic everyday soap and it's not a \"relaxing\" smell by any stretch of the imagination. The refreshing/clean scent might work better as a daytime moisturizer but it's not something I want to smell on my bed pillow. Some might not be bothered by the scent in which case it would probably work very well for them either day or night.

The hair did have a smell once it was delivered but I soaked the hair in fabric a little bit of softener and vinegar with a lot of water before installing it and it took away the smell. The hair is kind of rough but its kinky braiding hair so that's pretty normal. I would recommend moisturizing your hair well before braiding. The packs were a decent size. I used three backs cut in half for medium size braids. I also have an undercut and would have probably would have needed 4 to 4.5 packs to finish my whole head.

Each of us took different times for the peeling to begin. I felt the skin on my feet getting tight a few days after using the mask and it took another 3 or so days for the peeling to start, so around 5 or 6 days for me. My kids loved it, I\u2019m not a huge fan of peeling skin off my feet. I took a shower and used an exfoliating brush and got a lot off. My foot feels alittle tender kinda now while it\u2019s peeling but nothing uncomfortable. All the areas where the skin has already peeled is super soft though so all-in-all totally worth it.",

This makes a comb unnecessary (because it has the nylon pins), and the boar bristles are very  gentle so the brush doesn't pull on my hair as much.  I am really glad I bought this.

                "text": "Thanks to a series of unfortunate events involving a car accident AND a bike accident, I am the (not so) proud owner of a partial denture. For quite a while, I just used two old margarine tubs to soak my denture. (Pro tip: soak your denture in plain water in a separate container and then rinse it thoroughly before putting it in the cleaning solution, and then your cleaning solution won't get nasty.) But when the lids of my margarine tubs started to crack, I decided to get some \"real\" denture cups. Yeah...I should have just eaten some more margarine and washed out a new tub.<br /><br />These cups are not in the least impressive. The lid of the blue cup snaps shut but isn't remotely leakproof--tip it just slightly and you'll have water or cleaning solution sloshing all over. The lid of the white cup doesn't even snap shut. It just barely rests on top of the cup and strainer, and if you don't watch what you're doing when you pick up the container, you'll find yourself holding the lid and looking at the cup and water/solution all over the floor.  Furthermore, the two cups are far too hard to stack. The white one can't go on top of the blue one because the lid of the blue one is curved, but putting the blue one on top of the white one is precarious because the blue one is wider. And I find it surprisingly annoying to have two containers that won't stack taking up twice as much space as necessary in my tiny bathroom. About the only feature of these cups that is at all handy is the little strainer thing, and since my denture is plastic and floats, I don't find even that feature very useful.<br /><br />Bottom line: you can soak dentures in pretty much any container, and you can find two small plastic containers with flat tops and secure lids for considerably less than the cost of these. Toast with margarine, anyone?",

Takes a little practice to get it down, and you do need to wear the heat glove so you don\u2019t burn your fingers. My hair never held curl well , but with this iron I can go to sleep and still have curls the next day!! I do use a thermal protection firm hair spray and that probably helps the curls stay in longer.<br /><br /> Also love how this wand doesn\u2019t accidentally shut off when using it!  Buy it now, so great for the price!",

I have naturally curly(2b or 2c on a good day) and sometimes I get spots where my hair just falls limp and doesn't want to curl that day. That's why I wanted a curling wand, so I can add curls to the spots where nature took a break. I decided to give this a try and I was actually able to get a curl out of it. Now there is a learning curve and it was not perfect my first time but it was better than anything I have ever been able to do. I am so happy. The only thing I didn't like was that the curl didn't last that long in my hair but to be fair neither did my natural curls. Would totally recommend.",

It does not specify the diameter on the product box. I also cannot find the thicker/larger diameter bed head rock n roller at Amazon or Ulta so I might have to try a different brand. I am keeping this one, however, because my hair is long and different lengths so I can still use the smaller diameter one.",

It's so easy to use since you just wrap sections of your hair around it - I use the rounded sections since I just want a bit of a wave, though if you want more of a curl just wrap your hair around the smaller sections of the wand.

There were no directions explaining how to use the curling wand so I had to Google instructions. It heats up fairly quickly and I like the color of it. When I tried curling my daughter's hair though it was almost impossible. It came out looking more like a kink than a curl. Almost like when you take a hair tie out after sleeping in it and your hair will have an imprint of the hair tie...it was kinked not curled. I ended up having to pay to take her to the salon so they could curl her hair which they did using a regular wand. So ultimately I think this works fine on hair that is below shoulder length and anything shorter I'd say get something else.",
