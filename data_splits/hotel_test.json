I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute. Would HIGHLY recommend.",

The grab and go breakfast snacks were nothing special. The walk to the parks was doable. We cut through the cast member parking lot across the street to Disneyland Hotel and onward to Downtown Disney. Sometimes we used the Monorail. It cut out a lot of the walk.

                "text": "The hotel is located on the southeast corner of Walnut and West Katella (opposite of the Disneyland property on the Disneyland hotel side, to the right of the Denny's restaurant). The hotel lobby is located at the front of the property next to the high carport. The lobby looks beautiful, clean, and organized. This is where you get the grab and go breakfast. They do not have a continental breakfast, however you can get a brown paper bag and fill it with granola bars, juice boxes, fruit, yogurt, and pre-packaged pastries. There is also a business center here with two computers and a printer where you can print anything you need for your trip. They also have bathrooms for you to use when you check in. The property also has high-speed free Internet which works very well in the rooms. We stayed in room 204 which is at the back of the property, and our Internet connection was very strong. Check-in time is 3:00 pm and check-out time is 12:00 pm. The hotel is 100 smoke free. If you smoke in the rooms you will be charged 250/night extra. They have free parking and will give you a parking pass for your vehicle when you check-in. Part of the charge when you check-in is a 5/day resort fee. This is a mandatory fee that almost all hotels have. The taxes on the room are 17. The hotel is not pet friendly so don't bring your pet. The property is divided into two buildings the front building is the main building. This is where the laundromat is located on the second floor. The laundromat is open from 9 am-9 pm every day. It costs 2.00 to wash and 2.00 to dry your clothes. The gym is located in the main building next to the laundromat on the second floor. It is open from 8 am-10pm. The main building has an elevator to take you to the second floor. The second building does not have an elevator. The main building has a soda vending machine and ice machine by the elevator on the ground floor. The vending machines here take credit cards and cash as payment. The back building has a soda vending machine, snack vending machine and ice machine in the middle of the building on the ground floor. You can only use cash. Every few doors you will see garbage cans. The property is very neat and clean. There are a lot of plants so it looks lush. The pool is open from 8:00am-10:00pm. The pool is heated and it has a jacuzzi. The pool area is well maintained (cleaned everyday) with a lot of plants around it. It also has a small cabana with a table and chairs and a few umbrella tables with chairs. There is also a vending machine here. Entrances to the rooms are external meaning your door is outside. It's not inside the building. Our room was 204. It is located in the middle of the back building in front of the stairs. It is not a bad room however you can hear the people outside when they are going up the stairs. If you are sensitive to noise, this would not be a good room for you. However, if you're not this room is pretty good since it's located right next to the exit. You can see the Disneyland fireworks from this hotel and the sound they make is loud. So if you have little ones be aware of this. The property is very well lit which can be a problem depending on how you sleep. There is a light right outside our room that is able to shine through the blinds. This took a little getting used. They also have a security officer walking the property at night for your safety. As soon as you walk into the room, you will see a big flat screen HD-TV in front of you atop a 3 drawer dresser. The satellite provider is DirecTV. The pictures crisping clear with very vibrant colors. In front of the TV is the first of the double beds. The bed was nicely set with four very plush pillow's and one body pillow. The bed was firm and very comfortable for me. However depending on how you like your beds depends on how you would like this bed. I slept very comfortably. On the nightstand in between the 2 beds is a small alarm clock and a lamp. In front of the second bed and next to the TV, is a small table/desk. On top of this table is a small data box where you can plug in any of your mobile devices or laptop. It has USB ports and power outlets to charge your devices. On either side of the table, there are plush seats to sit in. They are pretty comfortable. There is also a floor lamp to light up this area. Next to the table and chairs is a small closet that protrudes from the wall. Located inside of this small closet is the ironing board, iron, suitcase stand, and hangers for your clothes. Next to the closet is the countertop where the huge mirror, sink, box of tissue, hand soaps, microwave, single serve coffee maker with packets of tea, coffee, and hot chocolate are located. The mini fridge is located underneath this counter along with an extra towel and the hair dryer. This is now the back wall of the room. The A/C unit is located along this back wall. It is pretty high up on the wall but it has a remote that you can use without having to touch the A/C unit. This is a great feature. The water from the sink takes a good minute to start warming up. There is no safe in the room. Finally the bathroom. The bathroom is small just like in all of the other hotels and it was in good condition. When you flush the toilet, it flushes quick with some strong force. The shower on the other hand has low pressure. To operate it, the handle has 2 knobs. The first knob is round and you rotate it to turn the water on. The second knob has a tab on it and this controls the temperature of the water. Just rotate it to the left or right depending on your comfort level of the water temperature. To get the water to come out of the shower head, pull the little knob that is on the water spout out. They give you towels for 4 people.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are pleased to know you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area.",

                "text": "Stayed here in July booked with Travelocity. A large part of my disappoint I will blame on Travelocity, I'm pretty sure I was booking a Best Western that was 'right across' from Disneyland and with the inflated price, I was sure of it. When I arrived I of course expressed my concern to the Front Desk and they happily called the other Best Western to see if there was avail, but there was not. They very kind and down to earth front desk clerk checked us in early (9:30AM on a Monday) and we got a 1st floor room very close to the lobby, which I would actually recommend. The room: beds were pretty comfy, bed linens were soft, pillows were plentiful, towels could have been better but did the job. There was a fridge and coffee pot in the room along with a hair dryer. AC unit was a bit loud but when we came back to the room for naps, it didn't bother us one bit. I can't complain much about the room itself --nothing went wrong or was out of place. The location: Here is where I'll get picky. I would not recommend walking to the park with little ones from here. You have to cross a majorly busy intersection, then walk through the Cast Member parking lot (finally found a safe walking area inside). This will bring you to the end of Downtown Disney, from here you can either take the Monorail to Tomorrowland or walk what would be another 'block' to the Main Entrance. I would not do this at night time! Good thing is there is an ART shuttle right in front of the property. I swear by these ART shuttles, 5/day for a shuttle to the front of the parks and runs every 20 mins. Again a positive thing about our room location is that we were able to just open our room door and keep an eye out for the shuttle and then run to it. Long story short, I overpaid on Travelocity, even after considering the location mix up. But the staff is remarkable so it made up for it.",

We were able to either drive, walk or take a shuttle to Disneyland with ease and the price was only about 100-110 a night. For the price, it was a good value. But an older hotel. While the rooms have been refurbished and are clean with nice linens, the A/C was an old swamp cooler in the wall and was very loud. And the only way to keep the room cool in 100 degree heat all weekend, was to run it 24 hours a day. Not great for sleeping. Also, there were small bugs that kept showing up in the bathroom, probably one or two a day. Not sure what they were, just kinda gross. The staff was friendly and efficient. The pool/spa area was very nice. The stay overall was good.Thank you for staying with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions.

It was never crowded and often we were t he only people riding. As far as the rooms go they were on par with other places I have stayed in the area. The breakfast vouchers for Denny's worked out great for my party of two. We were in and out in 30 minutes each day and the shuttle stop was right out front.

The rooms were very nice and clean, and the beds were sooo comfortable. Additionally, they were very accommodating of our weird schedules. On the day we left, my friend had a late flight, and they not only permitted us to check out an hour late, but gave us new key cards with pool-only access so we could swim and sit by the pool until it was time to leave.

Lenox mall is next door with a covered walkway to it, wife LOVED that. Houston's restaurant across Lenox Rd was superb(see separate review). Room was quite nice and the bedding was fabulous. The negative was the AC was on 67, woke up hot, turned it down to 63, woke up in the am still hot and it wasn't one of those blistering days that you can experience in ATL. Otherwise the hotel was very good and modestly priced for ATL considering the quality.PS: The parking lot requires the room key to use to exit and there is a box to drop it in, if you have checked out. A strange set up and I wasn't informed about this when I checked out. Had to buzz the desk and get them to open the gate, which held up 4cars behind me wanting to leave.Thank you for your excellent comments and feedback. I am sorry that you were too warm in your guest room and had some challenges with your garage departure. Rest assured we will have our engineering staff check the guest room thermostats and review our departure process in the garage. Thank you for letting us know. I do hope that you will consider visiting again to enjoy our services and conveniences.",

No issues. Breakfast was ok the standard Hampton fare. Coffee was always hot and fresh. Hotel also had ample parking and a shuttle service which seemed busy from what I saw. Hotel is near plenty of restaurants and also very near the Perimeter mall. When in the area I would stay here again. I think I found my new go to hotel in Atlanta. I would recommend an upper floor over lower as hotel is right off the highway. But 8th floor was very quiet. One thing I did notice in my room was some of the furniture looked bit worn in spots. Probably from wear and tear. I am looking forward to the new Hampton Inn currently under construction down the street opening soon.Dear Mark H,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta perimeter Center. Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property. Your your comments are very much valued. We appreciate your comments regarding our customer service and our hotel.

It was massively overpriced for what I got! Lobby being redone-it's a mess getting anywhere. Room is small and dated. It was clean and quiet though. Breakfast did not taste very good and was in a separate restaurant. I didn't even bother with the pool since it was in the middle of the building, didn't get any sun, extremely small, and right next to the makeshift lobby so every hotel patron could see you.I will spend a little more money next time to stay in a better location and better hotel.Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego. We are thankful for your feedback about our pool and your breakfast experience. Please accept our sincere apologies for any discomfort you experienced during our lobby remodel. We hope to have the opportunity to accommodate you in the future and we invite you to contact the management at the hotel directly should you consider staying with us again or if you would like to provide more details about your stay.

There was ample parking (even though the hotel always appeared busy). Checking in was quick and we were given a room on the first floor (no lift), perpendicular to the freeway. We did not find the noise from the freeway disturbing. The room was clean, modern, well-appointed (with sufficient power outlets) an en suite bathroom with tub (free good-quality toiletries provided), TV, coffeemaker (with supplies), microwave, refrigerator, hairdryer, aircon, iron, ironing board and an alarm clock/radio. Daily housekeeping was very efficient.The breakfast area (next to reception) was quite small (max 12 -16 people) and very busy however, you could also eat in the adjacent (outdoor) pool area or take food to your room. Breakfast was good (items promptly replenished) and consisted of make your own waffles, pastries, muffins, hard boiled eggs, bagels, hot cold cereal, fresh fruit, cream cheese, jams, syrup, coffee, tea and juices. There was free WiFi throughout the complex and two computers terminals and a printer in the reception area. Guests were allowed 20 mins free usage and up to 5 sheets of printing free. Staff were very helpful in dealing with our enquiries.There were laundry facilities on site and a restaurant/sports bar (called the Junk House) with a reasonable food/beer selection next door.Theres a trolley stop some distance away (I would not call it walking distance despite what others may say), however it will get you into the heart of San Diego. The area felt quite safe and my only negative comment would be that I had read this was a child-free hotel which it obviously wasnt as there were several families with children there. Despite that, I would have no hesitation in staying here again if I was in the area as the benefits far outweighed this change in policy.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you chose Rodeway Inn near Qualcomm Stadium and hope to see you again soon.",

                "text": "I've been a fan of SpringHill Suites since staying at one off the strip in Las Vegas. We choose this one in Seattle because we've had good success with previous SpringHill locations. The hotel is about a mile away from both the Space Needle and Pike Market. We walked once from the Needle back to the hotel and it wasn't too bad of a walk (one mild hill.) The other times we took the free hotel shuttle which will drop you off and pick you up at these two landmark attractions. The neighborhood around the hotel isn't the best, but I've seen worse. We felt relatively comfortable/safe walking around the area and ate at the Pho restaurant one block west of the hotel. There is a Starbucks across the street to the South of the hotel but it may only be open on weekdays as it is attached to an office building. Compared to the hotels nearest the city's landmarks and downtown, the price of SpringHill Suites was less. The buffet breakfast (hot and cold items) was good, though it can get crowded. Luckily, the bar area provides additional seating at peak times and they will open the conference area for seating (if nothing is scheduled.) My only gripe is the cost of valet parking. It comes with the territory (in-city accomodations) and was quite a bit cheaper than hotels right at the city center but I still don't like to pay for parking. Very close to I5 with very good access to I5 South on ramp.This is a really great description of our services, David -- thanks so much for taking the time to share this with those looking into our hotel. I'm happy that you were able to make good use of our shuttles to see the city, although I wish the price of our valet parking hadn't been a disappointment. As you mentioned, valet parking is an inevitable part of city life, but hopefully our other services more than made up for it. Speaking of which, good note about our breakfast -- we can get a little busy, and it's a helpful note for fellow travelers. Hope to see you on your next trip to Seattle! All the best,Frank F., General Manager",

We just thought, Hey, let's go to San Fran! so we just rolled in. After frantically searching for a room in a couple of downtown hotels, we finally got a room here for a couple of nights. So it's not cheap, but hey... We are staying in a the center of a major US city, and it certainly isn't the most expensive hotel we've ever stayed in. Be advised, parking is expensive. And while I wouldn't call it up-scale, it is very nice. It appears that the hotel has been recently renovated, and our room was nicely remodeled. The furnishings and decor are all very relevant to today's modern styles. The bathroom is about as physically small as possible, but big enough to get your business done. I mean how much time do you need to spend in there anyway The bed is super comfortable, which is really nice when you are on a road-warrior styled vacation like we are now! It is true that there is no bellman, but that's ok for me, as that is one less person I need to budget my cash for. I'm happy to carry my own bags. The location is fine, as we have been able to walk all around downtown, Chinatown, and the surrounding neighborhoods. Oh, and they have this nice water jug in the lobby, with fruit in the water, which tastes really nice! It's been a fine place to stay for this trip.Michael S - Thank you for such a detailed review about your stay.

When we arrived the first receptionist was quite short and boderline rude however the manager took over (Gutted I can't remember his name) and he could not have been more helpful. We had a few conversations with him and he was a genuinely lovely man who couldn't have been more helpful.There are no lifts in this hotel, however the aforementioned manager helped us up the many stairs with our luggage. I have never stayed in a shared bathroom hotel before but it was not as bad as I envisioned. They were always immaculate and never too much of a wait as there were 3 toilets on our floor.I would say if you are a younger traveller this may not be the hotel for you as we did get told off for laughing too loudly with some travellers from neighbouring rooms, however this was completely justified, just if you're after a more lively scene, pick a hotel with sound proofed rooms! There are no TV's in the room's and they are quite small but if, like us, you are after a relaxed vibe when you get in, this is great. (Another reviewer compared this hotel to 'staying at grandma's' and I couldn't agree more)The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. In some parts of San Fran I did feel slightly unsafe but could not fault the location of the San Remo at all, a quieter, friendly area. Opposite there is a great little cafe, Caffe Cappiccio (Helpful as the hotel does not provide a breakfast), some bars (our favourite being La Rocas) and a 10 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The restaurant of the hotel was absolutely brilliant. The food was delicious and there was a fantastic band playing while we were eating who also did a great rendition of happy birthday to my friend.All in all, this hotel was a great little find and I would love to see what the penthouse is like!Again, thank you to the manager, your customer service was impeccable.Thank you so much for your comments and feedback. Our staff are well-trained and expected to help our guests above and beyond, just like Kenley (our manager) did. We will look into the front desk staff you mentioned, as we are in the hospitality business and expect the best from our staff.Besides being close to many famous attractions, our neighborhood is very safe. We are very glad that you felt comfortable walking around here. The Fior d'Italia is America's oldest Italian restaurant and our guests get 10 discount. We hope you will choose to stay with us again in your next trip to the US.",

The bistro at the hotel is actually really nice, I loved the food there and found myself wanting more before I left, it's a nice touch because it gave me more to do while I was waiting around. The room's are exactly how you see in the pictures and are decent for the pay, the bathrooms are very clean and seem to be maintained well. I had an issue with not being able to get hot water at one point but that was fixed within half an hour. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and happy to help, they spent a lot of time helping me find my bearings and arrange transport which I appreciated as I hadn't got a very good knowledge of the area. I did find it a bit of a trouble to get on to the wifi which was frustrating but I was given assistance and after a while it seemed to sort itself out. The style and the artwork of the place is actually quite stunning, it made me feel like I was in a special little hideaway, and the area surrounding is quiet so I wasn't disturbed at night. I may not get chance to visit the area again but if I do I would be returning here, it was a nice experience.",

We reported all of our issues, of course, and the staff did their best to compensate us for the inconveniences. They eventually helped us find a different hotel, negotiated a discount rate, and paid for our cab to get to the new location. We appreciated the exemplary staff, but we were bothered when we realized the hot water issue had been going on for several days and they were STILL not disclosing the situation to customers as they checked in. That was disturbing. The silver linings of this stay...... clean space, good breakfast, gorgeous lobby, and a staff that was accommodating and helpful (but perhaps not completely honest).",

They retain many of the stylish elements of a W, but with a more spartan functional design with splashes of color or art. The Lobby features a pool table, WXYZ Bar and small swimming pool. There are comfortable seating areas to work or lounge around and there are board games and even a Happy Hour.The rooms do not have bathtubs, so not recommended for those with young children or those that absolutely need a tub. Another nod to functional design is there are no cabinets with drawers only open shelving. There isn't Room Service or Bell Staff (carts are available), but there is Breakfast, food and snacks available for purchase in the Lobby. The 9 Breakfast Combo is a relative bargain. Self-parking is 20. There are parking lots nearby, ranging from 3.50-5.00, if you are looking to save even more. It is centrally located literally steps from the Olympic Park, Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola and CNN Center. It is about 15 minutes from the Airport, if there's is light traffic.If you have the proper expectations regarding its limitations, this hotel is lower priced non-traditional option.",

The Aloft is very similar to the W, but without some of the frills, which is fine when you save over 200. The rooms were quiet and self parking behind the hotel is secured and only 25, unlike some exorbitant valet fees you can be charged in the ATL. The rooms have complimentary coffee machines included as well as the Bliss bathroom amenities you find in the W. breakfast is self-serve, a-la-carte and offers hot prepared to order sandwiches for 6 - a nice break from the one-price buffet option that many lower cost hotels offer. I hope SPG continues to build these properties as we will seek them out in the future.",

The Aloft is centrally located, the staff were extremely helpful, and the room furnishings were streamlined and nice. The only issues I had were with noise (the walls are a bit thin, and on Saturday night the noise from upstairs and nextdoor neughbours was a bit much) and with housekeeping. They give you the option to decline housekeeping by-the-night in exchange for a 5 voucher or rewards programme credits. You indicate this using a door tag. I declined the first night, but didn't put the tag out on the other nights because I wanted housekeeping to come. Instead, I found vouchers under the door both days and no housekeeping had been done. This didn't put me out overly much, but it was a bit annoying.",

They could not find my business account on the phone---even though I have a corporate account and are one of the largest companies in the world. I was too tired to keep asking the operator. I booked and then immediately---and I mean immediately called twice to cancel as I didn't understand how far away the hotel was from the airport. I called twice and my question was brushed off. Both operators were very professional, but were obviously trained how to brush off those questions and immediately ask if I wanted to book something else. I have stayed all over the world for decades and have never, ever been charged a no show for cancelling within a couple minutes of booking. Heck, I've even been refunded airline tickets when I immediately cancel. You can tell me it was your policy, but the hotel seriously lacks the desire to do the right thing. I have stayed in another Aloft before and have been a faithful SPG member for many years. I assure you that I will avoid this chain and will spread the word within my company to do the same.Dear TampaDude2, We sincerely apologize for your dissatisfying experience while booking your stay. Its our goal to provide excellent customer service to our guests throughout the entire booking process, and we are very sorry we fell short on this during your cancellation call. We completely understand your frustrations, so we would like to rectify your experience by refunding your cancellation should you decide to personally contact us with your confirmation number. Please email our General Manager, Terry Hitt, at tery.hittaloftatlantadtn.com, to further amend your situation. Again, we are very sorry for your experience, but we hope you will consider staying with our hotel when you have more time to visit the Atlanta area. All the best.",

The heavy concrete look is predominant at the lobby area, which I didn't like. The room was fine and had everything I need in a room. I asked about dinner at the front desk when I checked in and they told me that I can either eat at their lobby bar or order from one (only one!) restaurant they would allow in so I should look at the menu in my room. There was no menu in the room. I called the front desk and when they finally were persuaded that I don't have that book with a white cover in my room they said they will send someone with the menu. I am still waiting... The next night I stayed at the W hotel. I paid 25 more and got much more... Aloft would not be high on my list next time I travel to Atlanta.Thank you for taking the time to complete the Guest Satisfaction Survey in regards to your recent stay at the Aloft Atlanta Downtown. As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay.

The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last!

We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided.

I had to carry all my suitcases up three flight of stairs just to get to my room. I even had to help two elderly people carry their suit cases up the stairs. The layout of the hotel map is confusing as it is. If anything the Hotel needs to add more elevators for each building and not only for two buildings. The only reason I booked this hotel was due to the lack of hotels during Comic Con. I won't be going to this hotel again.I am so sorry to hear you experienced inconveniences while getting around the property. This is not the kind of experience we want our guests to have. Our team can usually assist folks with luggage and getting to the room, as most hours we do have a bellman. Also, seven of our eight buildings have elevators.

The rooms have been redecorated and redone, into a quality that resembles most true 4-stars in clean design and comfort. The bathrooms aren't as plush, nor are the linens. It's a 12 cab fare to the arena. I'm sure you could walk, but it wasn't the season when we visited. For warmer weather, there was also an exterior door in our room.

For us, the noise of the airplanes did not bother us. Once and awhile you noticed it but nothing crazy that we couldnt sleep. But what do you expect youre by an airport. They have a really nice shower with a sliding door for privacy. No lock on the door but it slides shut for privacy. Also had a fridge which was a plus as well as a coffee maker :) Down in the lobby they had a station called refresh, and that was really cool. You could get food, snacks and ice cream. That made it easy because you didnt have to leave the hotel to get snacks if you were hungry. They had an outside sitting area which was really chic and modern. It was nice to watch the planes fly in. Another awesome feature was they had a 24 hr. gym and it was a nice one. Not sure about the pool hrs. but they had a nice sized pool there as well. Only problem we had encountered was with the gate. We could never get it to work when we left and entered, Always had to bug the poor girl inside to open it for us. Other than that it was a beautiful modern hotel with great amenities, clean rooms and a friendly sharply dressed staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again. I loved how modern this hotel was and how it had everything we needed that I actually want to go to some of their other hotels in random states just to try them out too.",

We were reassigned to a non-smoking room with two beds. Night clerk was very friendly and accommodating. Next day, we placed do not disturb sign on door as we had checked in really late. Approximately 11:00, we left room and went out to have lunch. Returned to room approximately 2:00 pm and discovered that room had not been cleaned. I called office and told them we needed our room cleaned and also informed the maid as she was in the room next door. The front desk clerk this time was very rude and told us that it was our fault since we had placed the sign on the door. When we returned to room at 10:00 pm, we found the room had not been touched. Night clerk said he could do nothing for s but did offer to bring us fresh towels. This hotel will NEVER get a single penny of my money again. The maids are inept and management is badly lacking.Thank you so much for taking the time to review our hotel, and thank you for your feedback. As the new manager of this property, I'm very interested in what our guests have to say. First, let me apologize for the confusion regarding the bed types service in the room you reserved. This is a training issues that I will definitely address with my front desk staff. We are working diligently to make improvements to our property, including retraining in every department. Our goal is a guest experience that creates loyalty.Please know that I am doing everything I can to make that a reality. And it's guests like you, that give honest and fair feedback, that make it possible. So thank you again, and we would love the opportunity to show you how we've improved. Hope to see you again soon!",

The door person was friendly and helpful every day of our visit (stayed 2 nights) and Ben L. at the front desk was engaging and full of personality. That makes a difference because it really gave an indication that if he was cool, this hotel must be as well. He offered to help us find spots to eat and gave great directions. The lobby there was so beautiful all decorated for the holidays. The room was generally well appointed with a mini-bar, two closets, plenty of room space, but the downside O.M.G. the bathroom was smaller than those in Paris! I mean teeny tiny. But even with the microscopic bathroom, I still LOVED the place. And I'm tell you, it was in large part due to how clean it was and how nice the front desk was. I'd go back and I'd recommend this place. Oh, and it's perfect walking distance to so many things...but if you're not a local, just be careful of some of the spots to steer clear at night.Dear Kimberly H,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments. We are elated to hear Ben and the rest of the team ensured a great stay for you and your friends.

Yet here the minimum starts at USD 280/- excluding the taxes ! . Good: What not to like about this property !!! Everything was great. The location, the spacious rooms the view the room service the in room dining the restaurants even the Spa. Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room. My most concerns and worries normally in any hotel is the cleanness of the bathroom and toilets and here it was just perfect.",

The rooms need a facelift and I have stayed in better for half the price. The restaurant for breakfast is soulless and very expensive and not up to much.

If you want to escape the incessant pounding music and Kardashian wannabes of the SOuth Beach hotels and neighboring Eden Roc of Fountainbleau then this is a great option. But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place.",

                "text": "Weve stayed at the Galleria Park Hotel a hand full of times over these past 10+ years. It's a nice quaint property. My wife and I were booked to stay there this last weekend (6/29-7/1/2018). However, upon confirming our reservation online last week, I noticed that a new Urban Amenity Fee fee was added and my new stay total was increased by almost 50. I was not contacted when this fee was imposed. I inquired as to what additional amenities this fee would be providing, above and beyond what was already offered at the hotel. Unfortunately, the General Manager Suzie Yang didn't feel it was necessary to respond. So, I cancelled and will not patronize this property again. It seems San Francisco boutique hotels feel their properties are worth the extra fee. Why not just raise the daily rate instead of adding deceitful fees We, instead, booked at the Hilton Union Square on O' Farrell Street. The Hilton was not only less expensive, they don't charge this ridiculous and underhanded Urban Amenity Fee. The Hilton has MANY more amenities and is actually located closer to Union Square. There are a multitude of restaurants and bars in the area, unlike the Galleria Park.Dear David S,We are deeply saddened to hear the Urban Amenity Fee has caused you to make the decision to stay elsewhere. We instituted this fee with the new year 2018 as a means to provide extra benefits for our guests.The 20 nightly charge allows us to deliver far behind the included amenities from the past. With our nightly sipping hour, we have introduced the service of gin martinis on top of the wines, WiFi access has been upgraded to higher speeds for all guests, all local and long distance phone calls are now available with no extra per usage costs, we now have phone chargers as well as portable power banks for our guests to utilize during their stay, water bottles are now provided without the high cost of the mini bar, and we now have passes available to be used at the 24 Hour Fitness studio. Our belief is to be transparent regarding this fee, which is why we disclose the added cost for our guest at the time of booking, in the confirmation email and once again reiterated at the time of check-in.We hope you will reconsider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you back to San Francisco.With warm regards,Jeffrey RosenkrantzAssistant Front Office Managerjrosenkrantzjdvhotels.com",

Be advised, most maps and our GPS did not recognize Ted Turner Drive, it was named Spring Street. I was quite surprised how easy it was to navigate the traffic and enter their parking lot. Once we parked, we never moved our vehicle until we left on Thursday morning. If we hadnt been staying at hotel, we would have incurred a 20 per day parking fee. However, the Hampton Inn waived this fee and gave us a parking pass. Make sure you place unobstructed on front mirror. The parking lot owners will put a boot on any vehicles with expired or non-stickers. It was very easy to recover a luggage cart and transfer our stuff to the hotel check-in station. We were very impressed how clean, and efficient the hotel lobby was. Princess, the hotel manager worked tirelessly checking us in. It is always so nice to sample fresh cookies and enjoy hot beverages during this process. We stayed in a King Bed Suite on the 5th Floor in room 513. This turned out to be an excellent location selection within the high rise building. We not only experienced solitude and quietness but I felt very secure. The amenities in our room included a separate sitting area with extra TV, refrigerator, and a microwave. Our room was maintained at an excellent state of cleanliness by very courteous and interactive housekeepers. If youre searching for a great hotel which is very close to Olympic Park, public transportation, and sights like aquarium, CNN building, and the World of Coke this is the one for you. The hot breakfast that is served free from 6AM to 10AM daily was one of the best tasting, excellent choices, and smoothly efficient that I have ever seen. Given the oodles of hotels that we have stayed in over the years, this one captured our amazement and our respect. I would definitely stay here should we return to Atlanta.Thank you for providing this valuable feedback. Our team will be elated to know that your stay with us was enjoyable. It was our pleasure hosting you, we look forward to your next visit to the Atlanta area.At Your Service, Natasha BoydGeneral Manager",

The mattresses were not quite was I am used to at other Hampton properties (not quite at plush), but the bedding was clean and nice.

They charged 18/night for your car, and security is tight so you have to run out to your car to put out a tag so they don't boot it. The lobby is also very secure, you need your key just to get inside the door. I went to the gym downstairs and there were 3 treadmills, 1 elliptical, weights, a mat and a bike. The equipment was pretty new but you could tell it was well used. There was 1 treadmill that was not working, and one of the employees was trying to help me get it started but unfortunately they needed to call in order to have someone come out to fix it. Overall, it was a decent workout facility for a hotel, no frills but definitely usable.One of the downsides to our room was our shower, the water flow was very low and it felt like a slight mist while you were in the shower. I understand this may be more environmentally friendly, but in the meantime I spend more time in the shower trying to get clean....On the other hand, when we requested more towels and an extra blanket, there was an employee at our door in well under 5 minutes. We went down to the breakfast (which is included) around 8:30am and it was already really crowded, and it was a Saturday. My advice is to get there early, especially when it closes at 10am!! There were a variety of healthy options. There was hot oatmeal, waffles, muffins, bananas, apples, honeydew/pineapple/grapes. The oatmeal was slightly cool by the time I got to it--part of the reason why I suggest getting there early. There were 4 different types of cereal to choose from, regular cheerios included.Overall, for the price of the hotel and the central location, you can't beat it. However, I'm not sure what the other hotels in the area are like, so I can only compare this location to other Hampton Inns I've stayed in in the past.",

We were greeted at checkin by two very friendly clerks. We were a little early, but our room was ready. True, the rooms are on the small side, but that doesn't take away from how comfortable the room really was. Every employee that we encountered were very friendly and helpful with directions or suggestions for restaurants or whatever. The breakfast is just what you are used to from a Hampton Inn....very good with plenty of choices. Cold water and cookies were available a the front desk when you came back to hotel in evening.

So we decided to try the Ivy Hotel by Best Western. And what a great surprise! The rooms were huge and very comfortable (all recently remodeled), and the location was great. We were literally 10 minutes from Youtnville yet we only paid half the price of staying in Yountville. If you want to see Napa but not pay a fortune to do it - this place is for you. And there is a great restaurant two blocks away (Fume)....make sure you check that out too.",

The Negative: the mattress was extremely hard and uncomfortable, the bathroom sink didn't drain and overflowed while we were brushing our teeth, the bathroom light only worked when it felt like it, and the kicker was the complimentary breakfast was by far lacking. not allot of options for a BW Premier property and the items that were offered were either stale or expired, not to mention the breakfast room was so crowded we had to line up in the hall to get something to eat and bring it back to our room. Our expectations were much higher and we left feeling disappointed in our stay at the Ivy Inn.",

Didn't have much time and found this property, which was relatively close to downtown Napa and the other wine tasting events. I have to say in all honesty, we weren't thrilled about the prospect of staying at a Best Western, BUT, it turned out fine. The property looks as if it has been renovated recently, rooms are very clean/nice and the location was solid. If you need a place to stay in the Napa Valley without completely breaking the bank, this isn't a bad option. Don't let the BW name fool you. Guess Premier means something. :) Also, if you're looking for great wine, check out the Backroom in downtown Napa. Dan has a tremendous selection of wines that you won't find other places. Also has tremendous knowledge.",

We were moved to a third room with a sink that didn't work very well, but we were so tired of moving we decided to deal with it. We came back from dinner and found no wine and it was brought up only after we had called. The final straw was the lack of room cleaning. The maid service didn't stop by despite our calls for 2 days and would only pick up towels and most days cleaning service didn't show up until 4-5 in the afternoon. Trying to bill this Best Western as upscale is a joke. The service was unacceptable and they deseperately need to work on their house keeping and sink issues.",

Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop).

I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable.

Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location.

I stayed with my family and the room was a great size especially after the hotel we came from in Santa Monica the previous night. I loved that we received breakfast so you have that option for something quick. The front desk service was great though the housekeeping was mediocre. The housekeeper tried getting in our room at 4:30 in the afternoon when my daughter was returning from the beach. The towels that they offer you for the beach and the pool are a joke, just a bit bigger than a hand towel. I would recommend bringing your own beach towels or you will need to purchase them when you get to the beach. They do offer you to use 2 beach towels that you can use but if you have a family you need more than that.Awesome feedback Heather! We are glad you chose to stay with us during your recent trip to San Diego. Youre right about most of the hotels in the area being about the same price. What sets us apart from the rest is our location as well as the fact that we offer a hearty complimentary continental breakfast and we offer the lowest price for secured parking in the area. We know that there are many options when staying in the area, but we strongly believe that we offer the best value for the price. Our housekeepers are usually cleaning rooms until 5:30 pm and we do try to get to our in house guests as quickly as we can. As for the beach towels you will be glad to hear that we recently upgraded to bigger, thicker towels for our guests to use at the pool and the beach. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope to see you again soon.",

                "text": "Okay, here's the scoop: Yes, the rooms are small, yes, the rooms (many of them) not only have no view, but actually overlook a brick wall(this is NOT charming, as it would be in say, New York, or perhaps London - it is dark and annoying). However, to balance that out, the staff is very interested in doing what they can for you, and even more interesting (and appealing) is that they don't get defensive or bristle when doing so.As another reviewer said, if you can score a corner room, you will have more space - as the standard rooms are diminutive by any definition. Again, on the bright side, while not actually IN the French Quarter, the hotel is one block west of Canal, and Carondelet St. (the street the hotel is on) turns into Bourbon St after crossing Canal ... so can't get much closer. There is a Walgreen's two blocks away, and The Riverwalk Mall is only about six blocks ...near Harrah's casino. Cloud: Valet parking costs nearly 27 a night. Silver lining: The valet is friendly, helpful and seems to be expedient. The only other thing that might affect our decision to return (and this is not the fault of the hotel) is that the sidewalks are closed on alternating sides so that you MUST cross the street in the middle of the block to walk down to the French Quarter. In other words, as you turn right out of the hotel, the sidewalk is closed on the right hand side, so you walk on the left hand side, then a block down, it is closed on the left, so you must again cross mid-block to walk on the right. We had a toddler in a stroller with us, and that made getting to and from a bit of a challenge (there are street car tracks down the middle of the street - making a stroller a bit cumbersome).",

Free bottles of water and snacks were given to us upon arrival. Our luggage was held until our room was ready. The rooms we were in on the 12th floor, 1203 and 1204 were spacious, clean and quiet. There was a fridge, microwave and coffeemaker in the rooms and free Wi-Fi. We did not hear street noise or other guests in the rooms next to us. There isn't much of a view except buildings, but we were out and about most of the time anyway. The breakfast buffet on the 4th floor was very good with more than enough hot and cold food choices. You can also get a breakfast to go bag if you're in a hurry. Free bottles of water and cookies were available daily from the front desk. The hotel is an easy 2 block walk to Bourbon St. It's also very close to the street car stops. Overall, an excellent stay!!Thank you for staying with us and your great review on the hotel. We are so happy to have been part of your experience here in New Orleans! Great to see you enjoyed the hotel and your stay here. Hope everyone had a blast in New Orleans and we would love to see you again!Thanks!",

This is not your cookie cutter chain hotel. It occupies a building constructed in 1903, which was, at the time, the tallest (14 stories) building in New Orleans. It's located 1-1/2 blocks off canal Street and the French Quarter. The building is fully renovated/updated with all the amenities a business or pleasure traveler could ask for. My corner room had 5 windows reaching all the way to the ceiling. There is free WiFi and the free breakfast includes hot and cold items including fresh fruit. The St. Charles street car runs in front of the building. The building feels very safe as you use your room key-card to open the main doors after hours and in the elevator to access for all but the first floor. Staff is helpful and polite, and as with all Hampton Inns, there is a 100 satisfaction guarantee.",

Anytime we called to ask questions of the front desk, out concern was taken care of within minutes and questions answered immediately. The trolley in front was out of service, but the trolley on Canal street and buses are minutes away. You can get every where on these modes of transportation or on foot. Everyone in this city is so friendly and willing to aid tourists. If I ever visited New Orleans again, I would not stay anywhere else.This hotel does not have a pool or spa. It also does not have a restaurant, however there are 100s aroundThank you so much for staying with us during your AARP convention I am so pleased you guys enjoyed your stay! I'm happy you were able to still take advantage of the street car on Canal even though the St. Charles one was not online.

I thought I left my glasses in the room and the hotel even called me later to let me know whether they found them. Stayed with children and they loved it. Hotel rooms were very quiet. Beds were comfortable and the linens were good quality. Could not hear neighbors. Wi-fi worked perfectly. Parking was very convenient underground. Walking to everything around easy.

We arrived really early planning to park our luggage and walk around the lake until our room was ready. We were lucky enough to have Becky Schaefer check us in, what an amazing experience this was! She was so friendly and immediately wished us a happy anniversary. She thanked us for choosing their hotel and offered to keep our bags while we went to lunch, even suggested a few venues within walking distance. Then, all at once she said they did have a room ready if we didn't mind the 3rd floor!! This was 11:00!! We were thrilled and checked into our room. The room was well appointed and spacious (considering we just came off our cruise in a cabin half the size). It was warm and sunny so we changed into shorts and then a knock at the door....in came a bottle of wine, chips and chocolates along with a note from Becky Happy Anniversary! Then the phone rang and it was Becky checking our delivery....I know this sounds made up but Becky is an example of awesome customer service!!!! Can't rave about her enough. If you check in to this hotel tell Becky that Kent and Carol sent you. You'll be guaranteed a BIG smile!!Hi C B,Thank you so much for your wonderful review and experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. I can't wait to share your comments to our Team. We are delighted to know you had great celebration-stay at our hotel. We hope to see you again!Sincerely,Dan Pham, Guest Service Representative",

The hotel met both needs. They provided a complimentary shuttle to the Metro (although I chose the 20 minute one time just for exercise). There were several good restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the fish restaurant nearby very much. I also chose fast food one night -- all within walking distance. I plan to stay there on a subsequent visit. I enjoyed the complimentary eggs and sausage each morning. (They had cereal also.) They are a little weak on facility maintenance but the room I had was fine.",

Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life",

They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe.

I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly.

We needed extra towels and a visit to the front desk to ask for them had the towels delivered to our room in about five minutes. The hotel is located in the middle of Monterey Park, which is a majority Asian populated city. If you have an issue with being served by Asian staff, surrounded by Asian guests, and having people in your hotel speak a different language with each other when they are not speaking with you, then you might have issues staying at this hotel.

The nice thing is that its close to the shopping mall which has a grocery store on the lower level! The mall also has a great food court also you can easily stock your room. The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. I would stay here again. However!!!! Get rid of the 7.00 charge to use the sauna, it's ridiculous moreover, they can't possibly be making any 'real' profit off of a 7.00 dollar charge.",

My iPhone constantly dropped the signal or could not find it at all. I ran a speed check and the results showed a download speed of 1.39 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.34 Mbps. Perhaps this is high speed in some countries, but in the DC area, I consider this to be quite slow. It was complimentary, however, where other places have a surcharge for internet access. -There was no thermostat for HVAC so the room would go from warm to cool based on the control dial on the unit which was not temperature calibrated, but was simply warmer/cooler. -The elevators were small and slow, but functional. -The 6.00 breakfast did not include eggs or bacon. I hoped for a better meal for the money. Choices included coffee, juice, cereal, milk, sweet rolls, and packaged pancakes. I did not try the pancakes. There may have been other similar choices, but there were no more substantial choices as I recall. The preparation area was quite congested. I might stay there again, but I would not get the breakfast or stay in a room with bathroom mildew.",

Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay.

I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them.

I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation.",

The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere.",

I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most.",

The main conference hotel was fully booked so I used Trip Advisor to look for an alternative, and found the Horton Grand. I wanted something interesting and authentic rather than international-hotel-chain-plastic, and the Horton Grand really delivered. Yes, it's shabby in places and some of the wooden furniture and fitments are chipped and knocked about, but that really didn't matter. Staying here was lovely. With the benefit of reviews from previous guests on TA I asked for and was given a room at the back of the hotel. People coming out of the nightclub opposite still got a bit noisy on a couple of nights (I was there over the Memorial Day weekend) but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't disturb me over-much. There was worse noise from the room upstairs: the floors (although carpeted) are wooden, and there must have been a family of elephants staying up there! It still wasn't enough to put me off though. If you want a quiet hotel, don't stay in the middle of the entertainment quarter!Service was good, my room was clean, and breakfasts were fine.If you want an experience that's a little different from the McDonald's type of hotel, this one is for you :-)",

It's walking distance to sights like Penn's Landing, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. The hotel is across from the US Mint, next to Ben Franklin's grave and near some good eateries like Sonny's and Happily Ever After. It also offers its own restaurant, bar and fitness center. Free wifi. It was a reasonable rate for the area. Parking was 36.75 for overnight but you can keep your car there the next day until 5pm. However you may be able to find a cheaper garage nearby. As far as the rooms themselves go- those I would rate a little lower. The room was a little on the small side and definitely could have been cleaner (like the bathroom and under the beds) but it was adequate and by no means did I feel like it was so dirty I wouldn't stay the night. Rooms are probably a 3 however. The room did have a coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator which was great! They are updating some different features so maybe this was part of it. Dear Trip Advisor Guest,Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and I would agree that we are in the perfect location to visit many of the historical sites in the area. It's a great part of town. Thank you again and we hope to see you back sometime in the near future. Regards,",

Also the front desk agent ain't even try to ask me would i still like the employee discount added in which if I was a front desk agent I would still asked the guest if she still wanted to add the discount.Dear Trip Advisor Traveler, Thank you for the review.

I stayed here to save money and to hopefully meet some other architecture enthusiasts. I had seen this hotel listed in an article listing places for people coming for the first Chicago Architectural Biennial in 2015.I didn't meet architecture tourists, but my fellow roommates were about the 7 most varied and amazing women I have come across in a long time. Let's just say that the first roommate I met was an Italian (Sicilian) who looked like your typical gorgeous, put-together Italian who was there for a conference from a residency in New York who is a neurosurgeon who stayed there in order to meet people. She introduced me to the hotel and to the other roommates not in the room at the time. From there I met an Indonesian coming back on her own to visit where she and her husband had lived as students, French student on her way home, local back from Cuba, Korean exchange student seeing the US, Bostonian in town for wedding (2nd generation from China), and a Detroit auto designer for GM (fresh from Australia).The location couldn't be better. I walked to almost everything. The hotel design is well thought out and interesting. The dorm rooms are tight but it was ok. I had the room to myself usually a couple of times each day.There are a certain number of details that are sort of loosely attended to. For instance the simple breakfast served is a bit of rolling chaos, sometimes no spoons, sometimes no coffee. But such an amazing collection of people in that room every day.I used their simple kitchen to cook for myself a couple of nights to save money and to just hole up when I was worn out. Overall, I felt very lucky to have the Freehand as my base for the week.Hello Kristi, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay.

It definitely feels like you are in your parent's basement in the 70's - but cooler. The cocktails are delicious. We had the B*tch Don't Kill my Vibe and the margarita with chorizo salt. Another friend got their famous Cocoa Puff Old Fashioned. All were delicious. We didn't eat at the Broken Shaker on this visit, but saw some food being brought out and it all looked wonderful.

In terms of cleaning day three I was greeted with a penis straw on the floor when i entered my room, not sure how this fell out of house cleanings supplies - but it had not been there before! Then there was the elevator trips, being pushed aside while a man stacked his 2 bikes in the lift made me wonder what I got myself in for. I also chose this hotel as it included breakfast, I was not advised at check in and in the elevator on day one another guest advised it was in the bottom level - unfortunately there was not a lot left and no where to sit, it was definitely a backpacker hostel feel and I never went back.

The Hostel is very modern, feels safe, is clean, with lockers in your room for your stuff, free wi-fi and the beds are comfortable. The bar on the main floor has a great selection of drinks and is very welcoming. The staff are all very friendly, and are willing to help with any questions you may have. A great hub for exploring the major city sites, and restaurants, and is considerably cheaper than getting a single room in any of the major hotels nearby.If you're good with hostels, and their atmosphere, I really cannot recommend anywhere better to stay in Chicago!Hi MattSRob, Thank you for staying with us and for reviewing your stay.

                "text": "I would recommend this hotel only for the young or quite thrifty or you just need a place to crash for the night. In that case, it is perfect and is inexpensive for a Queen room and the quads are even less expensive. A perfect place to stay cheaply for a music festival or weekend out on the town. Overall, I would not recommend staying here if you want to spend a lot of time in your room. Any time other than sleeping really. Although it is clean it is miniscule. We stayed in a Queen Room and the bed took up nearly the entire room. In fact you can only get in and out of one side of the bed as the bed is literally built into the wall and only one side is open so if you are sharing the bed be prepared to be disturbed or to wake up your partner when you need to get up during the night. I wasn't thrilled but that is my fault because I did not do my research. To be honest this hotel is really just a step up from a hostel. They have quad dorm rooms that are shared and either coed or female only. If I had seen that it probably would have deterred me from booking however our stay went well. The vibe was young, casual and welcoming and everything was spotless, clean and well cared for.My first impression of the hotel was a feeling of happiness to be off the street, it was cold and sleeting out, but the lobby was warm and cozy. I began to worry fairly quickly however, the desk clerk that checked us in obviously did not love his job. We chuckled to ourselves as we were greeted with a strong whiff of pot smoke as we waited for him to find our reservation. The good news is, the other clerk, a woman quickly began helping the next guests to arrive. Not only was it obvious that she liked her job, she was cheerful and efficient and she gave them pointers and information that our clerk didn't. Our clerk was virtually silent and that meant we were able to hear the other clerk's great tips about the hotel bar, restaurant and free wiFi. We were checked in and up to our room on the 11th floor in no time eager to get back down to the bar and have a drink. However, when I opened the door to our room I almost stepped back to head back down to the desk. It's my fault however, I had read that the rooms were small I just did not realize how small. This was the smallest room that I have ever stayed in. The room was literally only a couple of feet deeper than a queen sized bed which is 80 inches long. There is no closet only a tall locker that is built into the room and gives you room for the two robes and mini ironing board and not much more. There is a TV mounted above the foot end of the bed which was almost too close to watch for me, we left it off during our stay. There is a desk immediately across the room near the one small window and a small bathroom with a tiny shower and sink (very little counter space for anything. I had to put my curling iron on the toilet so it wouldn't fall from the tiny shelf that angled down towards the floor). The bathroom did have a nice feature however, a heater that you could turn on that quickly warmed the tiles up to make the bathroom nice and toasty when you got out of the shower. We checked out the bar but it was full. No where to sit and relax comfortably so we went next door to the Acme Hotel and had a drink in the bar there. The next morning we checked out and we were happy that we tried out the caf. The coffee was hand pressed and delicious and the croissant I had was fresh, flaky and so yummy.Hi Jacqueline, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am sorry to hear that the room size was disappointing during your visit. While our rooms are cozy in size, we try to make sure that is clear when describing to allow our potential guests to make the best choice to meet their needs. Although the rooms are cozy, we do have different lay outs where the bed is not built in the wall. We also encourage our guests to enjoy our large den space and guest kitchen as an alternative to being in your guest room. The Broken Shaker is amazing, so I am sorry you were not able to experience our cocktails as we were too full. I hope next time you are in town you can stop in and enjoy the Broken Shaker! If you would like to discuss your stay further please reach out to us at anytime. We hope to have you back in the future.Thank you,Jenna",

You could leave your luggage in a safe place. Breakfast was good enough. The location is amazing.

                "text": "I stayed with a friend at the Freehand for two nights in a queen bed private room. The room was quiet and clean, but very small. My friend and I were climbing over each other and our suitcases to move around the room. One thing that ruined the room for us was the lack of control over the temperature of the room. The weather in Chicago that week was in the mid-upper 60s, but the room was WARM. There's an A/C unit in the room, but no matter what we did to fiddle with it, it just would not get cool. Tiny room + humidity from showers + stubborn A/C + poor window ventilation stuffy stuffy stuffy.What also wasn't fun was being charged an extra 6.35 on my credit card when I checked my billing statement a week after checking out. I called in to ask about the charge and was told we had used the water in the mini bar. We had not. The front desk employee was nice enough to remove the charge, but is it not standard hotel practice to provide a bill of charges to guests before they check out Not doing so is at best questionable (why risk upsetting guests by not verifying mini bar purchases), and at worst predatory (are you just hoping we wouldn't notice). Also, 6 for a bottle of water I get better deals at movie theaters...In conclusion, if you're looking to be in Chicago on a budget, want to be in a good location, and only plan to use the hotel to sleep at night, then the Freehand might be for you. Just make sure to keep an eye on your bank account.Hello Jade Y, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am glad your stay was mostly enjoyable. I am sorry to hear, however, that the room was a little stuffy. I hope this will not stop you from returning in the future. I am also sorry you had a billing error.

When the housekeepers came to clean they took all 5 of our towels and only replaced them with three. This was not acceptable due to the fact that we had 3 small children with us. Once settled into our room, we received an upmost unwelcome guest: ANOTHER HOTEL GUEST. This hotel double booked and KEYED our room. My wife was breastfeeding and a stranger walked into our room. This is entirely unacceptable. Hotel management was informed, and an apology was given. In my opinion not enough considering it was a Courtyard by Marriott! It was unfortunate there was no continental breakfast even though this was known before check-in. Bed: Comfortable king size bed. Clean covers, fresh scent, pillows were clean and smelled great. There was pull out single sized pull out bed from the chair. Yes I said chair, NOT couch. There were spare pillows in the closet as extras. Bathroom: Shower only in this room. We were disappointed because this was not shared with us until we were in the room. There was a single sink. The normal were also there for use like shampoo, conditioner and soap. Hair dryer also as standard. There was also a single serve coffee pot (stainless steel.)Entertainment: There was a 32 flat screen TV with cable. Wireless internet was free, but very slow. Note: wireless was free for basic surfing. ie: Facebook, google, Myspace, ect. These small, non memory intensive sites are included. HOWEVER, if you wanted video chat, HD Skype, or other business needs, you would need to pay 3.99/stay for this upgraded internet. Comfort: There was AC in this room to help keep us cool and remove some of the humidity. There was a digital thermostat. Staff must turn off the AC before you arrive, because it was humid and warm when you enter.Overall: Hotel is worth the price. I suggest requesting a twin Queen room if you are traveling with a family or a couple that doesn't share the same bed. A King sized room with 2 adults and 3 small children didn't suit us. We would stay here again but with a different room choice.Thank you for your detailed review of our hotel. While I'm glad that you were happy enough to return in the future, I am profoundly sorry for the fact that we checked another guest into your room. This is unacceptable and I am very sorry. Please contact me if you feel there is anything I can do to make it right for you and your family. I'll be sure to share you comments with our staff so we can be sure to continue to improve our service for each future guest!We hope to see you again soon!",

Incredibly convenient location to lots of restaurants and activities, including the Highline. The hotel is also right across the street from The Chelsea Market, which is terrific shopping experience. I highly recommend booking The Maritime if you plan to stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The only caveat I have is bring earplugs for sleeping, or some kind of white noise generator to drown out the sound of car horns honking all night. Other than that, it was a great stay.",

It looked like they really tried to give a garden feel to it with hanging succulents and different plants all around. I arrived at 11, too early to check in but they let me park in their lot for the 15 (wish it were included),. The parking area is small but backing in helps. I have a Jeep Cherokee and had no problems. The room was small but clean and cute. I was there for a bachelorette party and fake diamond rings were hidden around the room, so I can attest to the cleanliness since 9 girls looked for rings in almost every inch of the room. One downside of the hotel was being woken up a couple different times by sirens and honking but it is the downtown area. Breakfast was very nice- pancakes, sausages, eggs, different breads and muffins, cereal, yogurt, granola, fruit, almond milk, teas and coffee. There was a waffle maker but I didn't see batter. The woman working in the breakfast area was very efficient and helpful. They had a nice little seating area outside and tables and seats outside some of the rooms. The hotel was walking distance to everything we did, maybe a 10 min walk. I would stay again. Hi Ms Ana N,Our entire team at Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn would like to thank you for staying at our property. It felt good knowing that you had a wonderful and pleasant stay. We look forward for your next visit to San Diego.Best!YChen",

We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 207. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",

The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",

                "text": "We stayed in this hotel or motel, because we were on a budget. And it really served its purpose. We prefered have more money to spend on dinners and on the parks, than to spend it in a hotel room that its only use is to get a good shower and a good night's sleep. It served just that. It was really practical. The staff were REALLY friendly, the parking was really safe, they monitered all cars, to make sure you were their guests. Checking in was a breeze. We were placed on the third floor, and it had a beautiful view to the Island of Adventure's Hulk and Towers. Its your average room, with average bed and furniture. The beds were comfortable, and plenty of sheets and pillows. There is a safe available free of charge, but you have to ask the key in the front desk. The safe is big enough to put your Ipad and documents. The towels could use an upgrade. There is a tv, with local channels. The A/C worked fine and it didnt make any funny noises. We even had to lower the temperature at some point. There is a mini fridge that worked superb! We went to Walmart and bought bottle of waters for the parks and we put in snacks as well. Housekeeping was pretty good some days, other days they just forget to put enough towels. The lighting in the room was pretty bad. The bathroom light sometimes came on, other times we dependend on the light of the room. Another weird detail is that the hotel room key is not your average magnetic key... It worked like a hard plastic card with weird holes. So if you loose that key, it would become troublesome to get an easy replacement. The telephone didnt work, and yes.. No wifi in room. The ice machine does cost you an extra fee, like .25 per bucket... But since we had bottles of ice cold water, that wasnt an issue. We didnt have any hidden fee, and it was a really great stay. Easy to locate and very centric in the International Drive. Close to everything: restaurants, parks, gas stations, outlet malls, cinema. GREAT, GREAT LOCATION!!!! About 20 min to Disney Parks, and 3 min car drive to Universal Studios Parks If you have simple needs, this is really your place to stay! Would recommend, and would stay again in a heartbeat! :) great christmas vacations in Orlando.",

Every day when we came back to the room after visiting the theme parks the walls were wet, all our clothes were wet and the beds were wet!Our view from the room window was a blank wall and therefore the room was always dark.The free breakfast in the morning was a joke, with a free for all for the toast, fighting for seating and a real cattle market. The pool was very small and you could not swing a cat in the games room (I use the term 'games' loosely) because the room is about 6ft by 4ft!).To be fair the only 'good' point with this hotel is the location. It is right on International Drive and takes about 30 seconds to get to wet n wild so you can walk there and save on parking.I ended up staying one extra night in florida, so I stayed in the Holiday Inn which is also on International Drive, about 500m up the road. What a pleasure! I thought I was in Heaven!!In conclusion, I would say, only stay here if you really really really don't mind the quality of the hotel and want a cheap hotel to rest your head at night.",

We arrived on the 23rd of December and Natalia was on the front desk, probably the best member of staff that they have, and we had to change room 3 times due to the disgusting smell. We settled on room 408 (top floor and has a view of wet n wild and Universal-one of the only good things about the place.) One way i've been describing this place to friends is for them to think of 'my name is earl'. Basically you enter the room on a balcony and the outside wall is 1 big window.. so you can't leave the curtain open at all if you're in the room! There isn't a window to open either .. so the only way to get air into the room is with the air con which is loud! The rooms smell of damp and the closets have mould patches on them. The cleaners didn't clean the rooms on a daily basis even though the latest we left was around 11am (we even left some crumbs on the floor to see if they hoovered, but they were still on the floor for about 3 days). The sheets smelt weird and im pretty sure the top cover has never been washed! The hairdryer didn't work... there was no Iron in the room although there was an ironing board! The Safe didn't work at first! There were weird brown stains on the bath. The Fridge was so cold that everything we put in there was frozen solid by the next day. Some of the good things- 15 min walk to Universal Studios, Wet n Wild over the road and and iride stop outside the hotel. BUT there are so many hotels close by and you'd get these benefits and a nicer hotel! If this hasn't put you off then you'll have to learn the hard way! We had to and stayed there over Christmas! we even booked a night at a different hotel for 1 evening! Don't do it!",

Pros:20 mins walk to UniversalOver the road from Wet n WildVery cheapWalgreens just over the road, as is a KFCDairy Queen around the corner for yummy foodComfy beds (really comfy)Free WiFi in lobbyCons:Not particularly helpful staffNoise constantly all through the night from iFLYTheft - we stayed in two rooms and something went missing from both of them (staff didn't seem to care, we got one item back from a cleaner after bringing the Police in)Decor - paint and plaster peeling from wallsCleanliness - floors and bathroom wasn't cleaned every day (although fresh towels were available every day and beds were made daily)Noisy hotel - constant noise from other guestsSummary:So in summary, the thefts from maids is enough for me to recommend you don't stay here (we even know the maid was still kept on even after admitting taking the item!!!!).Its in a good location but other better hotels are also in this area, so book those first.",

                "text": "Having read some terrible reviews of this hotel, l was slightly worried about staying here with my family. However, l can honestly say that it was our best holiday ever! Okay the hotel and rooms could do with a refurb but it was clean and comfortable. For the money you pay, you cannot expect 5* service so if you just want somewhere comfortable to collapse at night after a day in the parks/shopping, this hotel is great. The hotel's location is excellent. You can walk to Universal in about 15 mins (or call the free fun spot bus to pick you up - reception will do this for you for free), Wet and Wild is opposite the hotel, loads of restaurants are in walking distance (or you can jump on the i-trolley). All the parks are easily accessible from this hotel. If you want to use the wifi, you can only do this in the lobby or by the pool (some of the rooms near the lobby can pick it up if by the window). The breakfast is basic but fine, you can have frosted flakes, corn flakes, toast (toasters do take forever though), tea, coffee and orange juice. If you want something else you can pay for pancakes etc or just pop across the road to Sizzler for an all you can eat buffet (3.99 pp). There are lots of good places to eat on international drive, we really enjoyed Chilli's and Uno. There is also a great takeaway pizza place across the road from the hotel. Being a vegetarian in Florida was a bit awkward as they really love their meat (our waitress in Chilli's had never served a vegetarian before) but most places have basic foods like veggie burgers/pizza/wraps etc.The pool at the hotel is quite small but l never saw it overcrowded and its open until 11pm. The pool bar has a happy hour from 6-8pm and you can order burgers etc too. The staff at the hotel are lovely and friendly. Whoever you spoke too, they were always very helpful. If we go back to Florida, we will stay in this hotel again.",

Although there was an ironing board in the room, there was no iron. The bed sagged in the middle and the room was not well cleaned. All in all not a comfortable feeling room or hotel.

So armed with my bleach wipes and can of oust we arrived at the hotel. However, I need not have worried, as I was not greeted by a musty smell at reception, not rude staff. I entered our room apprehensively, and although it was very dated and basic, it was perfect for our familys needs. Cleanish, with a fridge and tv, room service everyday, and friendly, helpfull staff.The free breakfast was ok for a few days of the holiday, but there are only so many meals you can eat off of a polystyrene plate lol. The best thing about the hotel was it's fantastic location. Situated right behing a KFC, and Walgreens 24hr supermarket and right in the middle of International drive, we couldn't have asked for better. Universal is around a 15 minute walk from the hotel, but it's a lovely walk with beautiful gardens and little lakes on the way there. You are also only 2 minutes away from Wet Wild and a whole load of shops and restaurants.The transport links here are fantastic all the way up down I drive, and the stops are seconds away from the hotel. The free shuttle bus can be very busy, escpecially in the morning and on the 8pm and 10pm return buses from Disney. If you're only off to Aquatica for example, you are better hopping on the I trolley as it only costs 1.25 and your almost always guaranteed a seat.The pool at the hotel is open until 11pm, and its heated, so a welcome relief to your sore feet after a hard day at the parks or shopping.All in all, I would possibly stay here again. It is basic, but from the other reviews I have read, it is no more run down than the more expensive alternatives.",

The breakfast is pretty poor but for the price what can you expect It's not the type of breakfast that you can have to aim to fill up for the day: coffee, juice (not real), cereal, toast, but it'll do. The location is excellent, especially if you are not hiring a car. The staff were nice, although we didn't come in contact with them a lot as it is very much just a place to lay your head - not the type of hotel you want to spend a lot of time chilling out in. In our first room the safe was broken - I felt we needed one and they moved us staright away no problems. All in all in far exceeds expectations for the price.",

The room was beautiful and a treat for my husband and me, as well as our adult daughter. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The pool area is very popular and I can see how this would be a very busy place in the summer, especially, because it is perfect for children. We appreciated that it was a little more calm at the time we booked. The room is very spacious, well appointed and comfortable. Having a kitchen is very convenient. In addition, because of tropical storm Olivia we requested to extend our stay by one night. The resort not only extended but allowed us to retain our room, which we greatly appreciated. The few meals that we ate on site were great, especially the pool bar when we first arrived. The breakfast buffet, as others have mentioned, could be enhanced a bit. But since we had a buffet coupon for not using room service, we felt that offset the food. We rode the convenient shuttle to the Whalers Village and also used their excellent valet services. Being so close to the Whaler's Village and Lahaina, as well as the walking trail alongside the water is very fun. I really wish we'd had more than three nights there. I didn't feel we experienced all that there was to offer in the area so hope to return in the not too distant future. The storm slowed us down for a day, but even people-watching and storm-watching from our room overlooking the pool was fun.

The people are friendly, there is a lot to experience, and the kids (3 ages 8 to 16) were never bored. The 2 younger ones found instant friends. We did so much that we were all wiped out every night by 8:30. The concierge staff was great at finding us the best deals. One of the things offered was a photography session with Blink. It wasnt on the top of my activity lists, but we hadnt done it in awhile and I knew we might get a holiday card out of it. Tiffany made it fun, quick, and easy. And the pictures came out great. The concierge also booked us a last minute helicopter trip with Sunshine Helicopters to Molokai at a rate that was well below the published rate. We chose them because the price listed didnt have any fuel surcharge* like the others. Snorkeling at Molokini was awesome. Overall, the resorts food, staff, facilities and location are all top-notch.

But, it's a resort with lots of young families, so if you're looking for a quiet time by the pool, not gonna happen, although the plunge pool area is noticeably quieter. I don't get why you need a card for towels and you have to sign for reclining chairs at the beach where you have to place a tag. The Westin next door has a bar and casual dining that is closer to the ocean, which we preferred. You can use your room card to charge at any of the adjacent Westin properties which was good.The rooms, which are called villas for whatever reason are very nice, great bathrooms, very comfy beds, kitchens are very functional. The doors to the rooms all slam shut, which was bothersome.You will get asked nice and politely, several times to take a timeshare tour, you can't miss the tours , they are going on al day in a certain pattern like the jungle cruise at Disneyland. Timeshare isn't for me, it's akin to owning a boat, a deep money pit.There is a scent floating around in the lobby, but overall, the people are wonderful and we enjoyed our stay.Aloha sas2kauai,Mahalo for your in depth review. While it seems that we fell short on some of your expectations, we appreciate the compliments regarding our front desk and valet teams. Indeed we are a very family friendly resort, but we do have a quieter pool area in our Napili Courtyard. Thank you for the kind words about our Heavenly Beds and well appointed villas. Please return again to give us another chance to exceed your expectations.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)",

Rooms and room sizes aside (fantastic!) the service at this resort in VERY under par so far. We prebooked pool chairs over a month prior and they messed those up. Pool service is essentially none existent.... even when they say theyll send someone. Other then having pre booked chairs at the pool so you dont need to guard some seats at 7:00am dont expect - your money to go further then that. No extra service or help. Actually we had to change chairs 3 times day one as per their screw up. Room service. Also SO SLOW. Over 1 hour for coffee pancakes and bacon. Hoping that everything starts to click. 10 Years coming to the Westin Maui villas and unfortunately not up to the quality yet. Aloha Brittany A,Mahalo for your gift of feedback. Please be inspired to reach out to a Guest Services Manager on Duty should you want to discuss your concerns further. We regret that we were unable to meet your expectations so far, but hope that we may turn it around so you leave us refreshed and renewed.Happy New Year!",

We had 3 different reservations as one of us left from a 2 bedroom unit and we were to have to check out of it and then check in to a one bedroom (twice) before we were to leave. 7 nights in 2 bedroom, then 5 and 1 nights in a one bedroom. Without any request from us she upgraded our stay into the same 2 bedroom for the whole stay !! Its hard to describe how much this meant to us !!She is the best and am sure many know that. Earl and Sandi BlackabyAloha eblackaby,Mahalo for your review! Cheryl is a 6 star Front Desk Agent, who's passion is providing exemplary customer service for everyone she comes in contact with. Her goal is to follow in her father's footsteps and become a Hotel Manager someday and she is well on her way. Cheryl takes pride in helping people and making their stays memorable, so it was no surprise that she accomplished that for you.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)",

It was like having a home right on the beach. The resort has a concierge desk, which was very honest in their suggestions of places/excursions for us to go on. They had so many excursions options! We will definitely need to go back again and go on some of the excursions we did not get to go on due to lack of time. We spent a lot of the time just relaxing in their various pools and jacuzzi's or on the beach which we could literally see from the pools. Overall, it was the most pleasant stay that I have ever had, the resort had all you needed for a comfortable stay and there was plenty to do but if you needed to there was also plenty to do in the neighboring city as well.Aloha yqbettyboop,Mahalo for your review! We are pleased that our phenomenal concierge team was able to provide the framework for an excellent vacation on Maui. There are truly so many things to do and see on this world class island. Our 3 Bedroom Ocean Front Villas make our property stand out from the rest, at over 1,600 square feet in size.

He was wonderful - very helpful in linking our 2 extra nights though the resort so we wouldnt have to move. He did tell me he had requested one of the bldg 8 high floor one bedrooms 1 year in advance, as these have the best view. When I checked in the front desk told me since I wasnt an owner and elite member I did not get preference and I was l placed in a 5th floor room in bldg 7 facing the courtyard and other rooms. They moved us mid stay to bldg 8, but through this I came to find out there are very few 1 bedrooms and they all have poor views or face the pool where loud noise can be heard until late evening. So, if you are looking to book a 1 bedroom beware. Youre better off at KOR where there are ocean front and ocean view 1 bedrooms. Many at Nanea face the parking structure. That being said the rooms are new and well appointed. The shower in the the 1 bedroom was not great... tub with curtain. At KOR they have the nice walk in rain shower, double sinks and a large tub.We did come here the week of Spring break, so expected it to be busy, but it was a bit on the insane side. The pool was packed everyday and seemed over crowded. They seemed under staffed as it was difficult to find a server on the pool deck and it was much faster to go to the bar and order. The other thing we noticed was the lack of cleanliness of the place. Trash everywhere, no one emptying the overflowing trash cans. The lounge chairs were pretty filthy, clearly not wiped down. The beach here is nice, but as others have noted, smaller and rockier than at KOR. We did enjoy snorkeling off the beach everyday with little kids. The waves are gentle and great for learning. We also had spectacular whale action everyday.End game, even though its older we preferred KOR and will book there in the future. Aloha baflier,E kala mai. We apologize for not meeting your expectations. On a personal note, we agree the loyal Elite 5 owner who hosted your stay is wonderful and it was a pleasure assisting him in linking your reservations and providing a room move option for you and your family during your stay. Kindly reach out to our Guest Services Managers should you need further assistance.",

We were greeted by an enthusiastic King at the front desk, and had a great interaction with our concierge Carolyn. The cultural center was actually one of the highlights that differentiate this hotel from others of the same caliber - we were introduced to the language of Hawai'i for the first time, and it was a fascinating topic. Kudos to Kaimana for the splendid history and language lesson - we highly recommend checking this out!Another highlight is the availability of the shuttle service - we used it almost daily to head to Lahaina or one of the other SPG properties.Now for less savory impressions:The pool bar is not really a pool bar, as you have to get out of the pool and walk across a good section of the dining area to order from the bar. My quip about this may not have been received well, as we were charged 5 apiece for club soda from the tap. I understand that gouging is customary, but seriouslyMore disturbing though is the fact that after heavy rainfall, the boardwalk is flooded and pumps have to be brought out to drain the area. This is 2018, right This is the newest property in Ka'anapali, right They could not have dealt with the drainage during construction Again, seriously My final very minor frustration has to do with the utensils - and I've noted this before at another Westin: The knives in the knife block and the peeler are pathetic. I understand not wanting to have guests cut themselves, but it is more dangerous to use dull knives than sharp ones! And the peeler was completely worthless!All in all though, we have immensely enjoyed our stay, and since it's the first time we have visited Maui in February, we were delighted to be able to sit by the pool, facing the ocean and view the magnificent whales cruising by and breaching right in front of us.Aloha CatofSpade,Mahalo for your review. We appreciate the shout outs for some of our best associates! King, Carolyn, and Kaimana receive wonderful comments all the time for their aloha spirit and friendly customer service. We are glad that you took advantage of our Complimentary Westin Shuttle. Thank you for your feedback regarding our pool bar, our utensils, and our drainage. We will discuss these comments in our next department head meeting. Please return soon to enjoy the magnificent whales again!A hui hou! (Until we meet again)",

They did try to sell us a time share but they were not too pushy and we have declined an 1.5 hours presentation this time. We stayed at Westin hotel and spa and Westin villas before in Kaanapali area but this was our first time at Westin Nanea Villas. It was a very spacious 2 bedroom apartment with brand new appliances and big TVs in every room. If you skip room cleaning you can get free breakfast buffet worth 29.The beach with coral reef is one of the best on Maui for snorkeling but maybe not for swimming but we still enjoyed both. They have a lot of activities for kids (big and small). My 14 years old and her friend attended Puka shell and Tide Dye lessons for a little fee. There are Lei making lessons, Hula dancing. learning Hawaiian language and many other activities.We were quite disappointed in a pool area. First of all, why do you need so many islands in a middle of the pool They take a lot of space and don't really have any purpose. There is no adult pool nor adult area where grown ups can enjoy themselves without listening to kids' screaming all day long. During weekend, pool and grill areas were occupied by locals who'd bring big lunch boxes with food and alcohol, and listed loud music from a boom box. If you want me to spend 60K on a timeshare here I want my vacation place to be more private, more exclusive.Aloha IrinafromSeattle,Mahalo (thank you) for your feedback of your stay here with us at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. We are thrilled to hear that your 'ohana (family) were able to participate in our cultural activities able to take home a memorabilia from Nanea.

They stock the kitchen and provide detergent for laundry. It is great for families or guests staying more than a few days. The resort was very clean and customer service excellent. Everyone was very helpful and nice. Shout out to King at front desk for hooking me up with this upgrade suite. The pool was good size with 3 jacuzzi. I like that its beach front so the kids can bounce from pool to beach within a few feet. We purchased water and groceries at the Times supermarket about 2 mins drive fromThe hotel. They have cooked food there as well. We didnt get a chance to try the restaurants on site so Im unable to comment on them. Theres a coffee shop with some fresh fruits and next the front desk. Coffee is about 4 and decent. Overall i was happy with my stay but when we were checking out, I went to the front desk to confirm my balance and to close my account. I was told my balance was 40, which was right due to 15 parking and some coffee I ordered. Two days later, I see there is a credit card charge on my account for over 1000! The room was prepaid AND I made sure to check my account before leaving. So I have no clue what happened with this. I have left a message and awaiting for a call back to rectify this. The worse part is that I was charged the exchange rate for that day and foreign fee on my credit card when there should have never been this charge in the first place! So in regards for billing I dont know what to say. I would have said make sure billing is right before checking out but apparently that doesnt make a difference as I made sure of my final bill before I left to only be charged 1000. Aloha Mmark 8,Mahalo nui loa for your review. I believe we have your billing error all worked out. We apologize for falling short of our expectations with up to the minute billing.

The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The pool area is lovely although a bit small it does have a nice area for those with really little ones but we found it very relaxing ... ( there werent a ton of kids running around and loud) if you want even quieter adult time - there are a couple of plunge pools and many lounge chairs much further back from the larger pools where kids typically are. We are in a one bedroom premium and even though it is only the 2 of us there is a large dining table on the patio that seats 6 and in the kitch ( also seats 6) which would make it easy to entertain friends or family in one spot. Overall just a gorgeous property and we will definitely come back! Aloha Jenofwaukesha,Mahalo for your review. We are delighted that you are impressed with all that our property has to offer. Our wonderful staff is trained to anticipate and accommodate any and all guest needs. We cannot wait to have you return to our gorgeous property to make more memories at Nanea!A hui hou (Until we meet again)",

Upon check in we were upgraded to a three bedroom ocean front villa - what a treat. Every last inch of the villa was stunning.Kitchen - well appointed with everything needed to prepare former meal. Bedrooms - great layout and comforts. The mast also had the most stunning bathroom.Lani - the best part of the villa was the double lani with a seating area and Dinning area overlooking the Maui coat. Beyond the room the entire resort as amazing. The restaurant offered great food and service. The market had all kinds of great options - from morning coffee to grab and prepare options. The pool areas we awesome with an awesome kids pool and upper adult focused pool. Overall the ray was amazing. The photos speak volumes. There is much to say, but with a single night I can begin to capture it all. We will be back and can't wait to see how things develop. Aloha Kelsey A,Thank you for taking the time out to review your stay here with us at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed our three bedroom ocean front villa. The next time you visit us, please be sure to stop by our Pu'uhonua o Nanea Cultural Center to participate in a 'Olelo (Hawaiian language) class, ukulele, lei making or hula classes. Its so much fun.

The details from the lobby floors, walls and ceilings to the ground plantings have been so thoughtfully completed they noticed for themselves. We stayed in a suite just opened and have no complaint. I so have a suggestion though. It would be good to have an adult only area of the pool and hot tub. Aloha georgesA1682AQ,Mahalo for your review.

The room had a musty smell, and the beds were the smallest I've ever had in a USA hotel...it was clean though, if old, and the bathroom was very big for the size of the room. However, I ended up paying over 200 a night, which even in San Francisco is a crazy amount for what is essentially just an old motel.On the plus side, the staff were friendly, and it's located in a nice, safe feeling area, just round the corner from a great shopping and eating street on Union St in Cow Hollow, which I'd highly recommend.It is what it is....if you can get a good rate then great, if not I'd shop around.",

Probably the smallest double room weve stayed in so we had to be organised as we had 2 ski bags and 3 suitcases meaning space was limited. The bathroom however, was quite roomy! Parking in the main area was competitive at night but you could also park undercover in the laneway. The kids found a homeless guy with a bike in the stairwell on the first morning, however, we just used the other stairs or the lift. Internet consistently dropped out. Staff were lovely. Ear plugs were provided but we didnt need them as our room overlooked the laneway behind. Hotel was in a great location, within walking distance to the crooked part of Lombard St, Chinatown and Fishermans Wharf. Great for short stays.",

The pillows were dreadful and the bed was so uncomfortable, we felt unsafe in this motel as well, walls paper thin and doors slammin constantly , very noisy outside too- i know this is not the hotels fault but just adds to the awful stay we had. we paid around 85 per night for this hotel which may seem reasonable for location, however we stayed at the coventry motor inn just up the road and it was by far do much better than the Francisco bay inn.Overall good location and staff but dirty, noisy, dated , smelly motel rooms!!!!

(So much so, that we suspected the owner's relatives had posted the positive reviews). The location wasn't as close to fisherman's wharf as was stated. True, it was in Lombard street but it was a 20 min walk to the wharf, and walking back uphill Forget it! It is only for the extremely fit.We bussed it there and back and that was ok but for my mind a little inconvenient. We had a room on the top floor, unfortunately their 2 person elevator stopped at the floor below so we had to lug 5 bags up and down flights of stairs- no fun. The room itself was horrendous. Decor was the fifties with chipped pieces out of the furniture, no room to store our luggage (except for an open alcove that wouldn't take our cases, a filthy bathroom that still had previous tenant's soaps and mess on top of the shower rail. Bathroom sinks were filthy. We were also attracted by the free contintental breakfast. What breakfast The lobby office was 10 feet by 10 feet with a small table with coffee and packets of danishes. You couldn't eat in there and in fact had to stand in line (Half outside the door) to grab a quick danish. Our overall impression Yuk! Spend the bucks and go closer to the wharf.",

The room linens are clean, parking is free, and there are newish refrigerators and microwaves in the room.

Room was small and smelly, however the bathroom was really big and the shower had good water pressure.

No power outlets in the room, only in the bathroom. WiFi was fast and worked great.Location is great, close to public transportation and a supermarket.",

The area is very noisy and there wasn't much around within a short walking distance so having our kids with us meant that we either had to drive everywhere and pay huge parking fees. This is the first review I've ever written but I felt like I needed to say something about a place that (at the time) charged me 250 a night and delivered a room way worse than a motel 6.",

OMG scared the living heck out of us informed the management in the a.m. he didn't seem too concerned, actually he seemed annoyed.Yes it is within walking distance of all the best places, but the breakfast is laughable, and I swear there are working girls/men or druggies who frequent this hotel, there is just too much foot traffic on the balcony at odd times of the night,the management is just plain rude, once you have paid your money you are out of luck and they don't care.

And she needed half an hour to finish up!! Maybe that happened because it was Thanksgiving weekend...We were coming from a long drive that followed a long flight, but since we were also hungry we did not complain. Getting to the room there were no sheets on the beds (only on the mattresses) and no blankets. Since we started off on the wrong foot, it was hard not to notice the small details:The outlets were loose and you could not move the charger cord while charging somethig because it would fall off.We were sharing the room in four people and it got a little small with all the luggage we had.The bathroom was not the cleanest, and the way to control the temperature of the water is awful.The TV was big and looked pretty good but did not work. It was almost impossible not to accidentally hit it. I did not like the setup of the room, the position of the table and the mirror.The only pros are the free parking (unusual for the area) and the treats in the morning, like good donuts and croissants at the reception.",

The bathroom had cracked floor tiles, peeling wallpaper, stains on the walls, and the decor is overall is extremely outdated.The glass door of the office/reception area has been smashed, and the outlet in my bathroom burned out and destroyed my relatively new Braun electric razor. The manager let me know they tested the electrical outlets, and since voltage was apparently normal, they wouldn't do anything about my razor.The location is convenient, and the woman who checked us into our rooms was nice.

The Inn does sit at a busy intersection but with the A/C unit on in the room we heard very little through the night. We did face Lomard Street. The room was big with a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. These would come in handy as I would not consider the continental breakfast provided to be substantial by any means. However, it was something in the morning before leaving and finding some real food. The bathroom was big and clean though it could have used a couple of more towels. There was no problem having hot water for our showers in the morning. The linens were clean. The bed could have been more comfortable for our liking but we are all different and expect different things from our beds.Not being familiar with the lay of the land we took the info provided of others indicating it was only a 15 minute walk to the pier 39 and also used this in our decision to stay here. The location for being central is great. YOu are no more than 20 minutes to Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. If you walk the other way you are about the same to Crissy Field and the Presidio. The World's Crookedest Street is about 4 uphill blocks away. Getting to here from the airport was uneventful and quite easy. The neighbourhood it is in is safe by our standards and we did not feel uncomfortable walking back from the pier alter in the evening. There are some wonderful restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood as well no more than a 10 minute walk in the direction of the Presidio on Chestnut.The free parking and internet were also added benefits considering the cost of parking in some areas and other hotels in San Francisco.With all this said it is not the greatest nor is it the worst. For the money we paid in San Francisco it did provide value for our dollar. As others have stated if you want upscale you will pay for it but this is not that place.",

The parking was free, which in any downtown hotel is a good thing. Sadly, many of the cars are double-parked, which means leaving the key with reception. When we were ready to check-out, we had to wait for ten minutes for the receptionist to find the missing keys to a van that was blocking our exit. The 'free' breakfast wasn't much more than a small table containing coffee, tea bags, hot water and a few pastries (the table sitting in the hotel's lobby which had two chairs). The room was a little scruffy too. The decor was old, the fabrics were very faded and our entrance to the hotel seemed to be held together by the construction that was taking place.

Real coffee is provided for your coffee maker in the room, pick up your own half and half and have it in the fridge if you don't like instant creamer. Close enough for a healthy walk to the great local touristy places. Near public transport. The fridge and microwave allow for your own choice of snacks and simple meals. We stayed a week. We were put in the horrid, cramped, noisy room first night and made a fuss til we were moved to a MUCH better, way quieter room. No excuse for this since we had booked it months in advance, and because of the reviews had ASKED in writing for a quiet room, off the road.Free parking.

                "text": "We stayed at The Pearl a couple summers ago and fell in love with the place - and the burgers! A couple weeks ago my boyfriend surprised me with a trip back to our favorite San Diego hotel. We spent the first night lounging poolside with another fantastic burger dinner and drinks. Brian, our server, made us feel welcome right away and recommended the curried carrot soup to start - not something we would have gone with, but it was absolutely delicious. The following evening at sunset my boyfriend surprised me with a perfect proposal on Sunset Cliffs! Needless to say, we were on cloud 9 when we arrived back at The Pearl. The staff picked up on it right away and made our night so incredibly special. Brian was our server again and excitedly brought us complementary champagne to celebrate. While we had dinner, a couple of the staff snuck into our room (which was totally fine with us) and set up a bucket of champagne, some glasses, and a couple of awesome I The Pearl shirts with a handwritten note of congratulations! The Pearl staff went above and beyond, and these gestures really made an amazing weekend that much better. Their thoughtfulness has become a part of our engagement story, and we can't say enough how much we appreciate all they did for us! Thank you Adrienne, Maggie, Brian, and everyone at The Pearl!PS - Oscar the fish was a great roommate!Thank you very much for the awesome review. First and foremost. Congrats on the engagement!!!! Honored to be part of your celebration. Our burgers are amazing. Look forward to your next visit. Tell a friend.",

There beds were comfortable, but a bit tall, for me anyway. The air-conditioning in our first room was a bit strange and we weren't able to turn it on properly. The bathroom was a good size and they had homemade chocolate chip cookies in the lobby. I later found out that this is done from 3PM Monday - Thursday. A channel that was listed on their channels offered list, came up blocked when I tried to watch it. I just assumed that the subscription hadn't been renewed yet. But, here were the hiccups I mentioned in the title. The second time we stayed here, we came to our room and realised that you couldnt lock the door. It only rested. So if we went out, someone without a key card could enter our room. So obviously, we switched rooms. Luckily, to right next door. When we came back from dinner, I noticed that the toilet had flooded the bathroom. It was because we flushed it. It was as bad as it sounds, it was only a millimetre of water, but we had to change rooms again. So, overall, I really enjoyed this hotel, and even though we had a few inconveniences I still give it a 4 out of 5, I would stay here again and I do recommend it.",

Decatur street seems to be the next busiest street besides Bourbon Street, but you couldn't hear it from the courtyard or our room. My friend Jerome and I found the staff very friendly, and more than willing to help with anything we asked. Our room was small, but had high ceilings which made it feel larger. The bathroom was very small, and I felt a little cramped brushing my teeth or shaving in there. It would have been better if the door opened outward.Guests tended to flock to the courtyard in the evening, and were a bit noisy, but I was able to sleep with earplugs no problem. There's a cat that lives in the courtyard, and like the locals is very friendly and laid back. The pool didn't open until 10:00 am which I think is silly. Why can't we take a dip in the early morning In reality I don't think anyone would have cared if we did, though.There's no breakfast included, and no refrigerator, so you're on your own in the morning. The French Quarter doesn't have many places that open before 10:00 am, so if you want to eat before then I suggest Uptown, or the Business District.",

It's a nice, modern hotel in a good location, with all the amenities typically found at a Springhill Suites.However.....the Air Conditioning unit couldn't cool the room. I ran it all night and it never succeeded in getting the room temp below 70 degrees.Hotels MUST allow their guests to keep the room at the temperature they desire. This means installing AC units that are powerful enough to cool the rooms to the desired temp.This Marriott failed in that regard, and thus I cannot recommend, nor do I plan to return.This is so disappointing to see, and I'm so sorry that your room wasn't up to par. My team and I would have been more than happy to fix it in the moment, but I appreciate the feedback nonetheless. I hope you can give us another shot to show you the stay you deserve.

I'm not certain it was 100 the best decision.Yes, it is about a mile walk to the market - not too bad. We are walkers, so that is and was not an issue. In hindsight, it was raining significantly the entire day we were in the city. We were prepared for it so definitely not a challenge. What I realized, though, is the next morning after we had breakfast, it was really nice out and we wanted to go back to the market. We had to plan for that as it was about a 30 minute RT walk. Again - great exercise, but really would have been nice to enjoy the market for longer first thing in the morning and to walk along the water... The other thing to note is - that this property is located RIGHT NEXT TO the highway. So you will see and hear the rush hour traffic. The windows in the room did well with blocking out a lot of the noise and we were not kept awake by the traffic noise.We arrived around 10:00am, and our room was not ready. Wasn't fully expecting it to - you just never know. I was told it would be a few hours for my reserved room to be ready and it was at that time that I asked if there were any rooms available for a complimentary upgrade as I am platinum. We were told no - they were not available either. We waited about an hour for our room, but we had already left for our sightseeing after dropping our luggage. Honestly, I don't think that the room we received was a true upgrade but for one night it doesn't really matter.The lobby is inviting, textiles seem updated and the bar and restaurant are all right there. The restaurant does offer happy hour specials on select beverages and appetizers. Once we did return to check into our room, it was simply ok. It was NOT the as listed on the Marriott website Category 7 experience that we were expecting. It felt more like we were in a Days Inn. The kitchen gave us what we needed - a small refrigerator but the plates and utensils were paper and plastic I wasn't expecting that. And when we went to use one of the utensil combo packs, one of them was opened with the fork removed. Tossed that and we just used a fork and spoon from the unopened pack. The bed was comfortable and we slept just fine. Closet was super small didn't bother to put much in it - it would have been a hassle. Bathroom shower was really great with fabulous water pressure and we did not experience any fluctuation in the temperature. I did ask for a blanket to be in my room upon arrival via the Marriott app, and I didn't realize until crawling into bed that it was not delivered. So I got onto the app again, and after a few attempts was able to connect with someone - simply because I couldn't reach anyone on the phone. They did show up after about 45 minutes... But instead of a blanket, they brought an entire bed set - comforter, sheets and pillows. I was too tired to care at that point and just took it all. I used the 2nd comforter just to get to sleep, and tossed it off when I got overly hot. But I thought it was strange that the hotel didn't have any blankets Kind of them to deliver me something though!Breakfast was very busy. It is definitely a large buffet and will get you by. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, fruits, oatmeal. Food was fresh and replenished regularly. It definitely worked for our needs. Because we were out in the rain all day and wanted to get back to the hotel to rest for a bit, we did decide to not go out for dinner and take advantage of the hotel restaurant. We sat in the bar area right next to the warm fireplace - fabulous! I had the chicken entree my husband the burger. Food was good portions were large, and our bartender / waiter was kind and helpful.The Uber ride from this hotel to the cruise pier was about 25. Overall, I'm not sure if the varying cost difference to stay at this property vs. a full-service Marriott was entirely worth it. This hotel does need some updating for sure! Totally not a category 7. For the additional money for the Uber ride, and not having access to the concierge lounge for breakfast as well as evening happy hour - having to pay for dinner and the taxi ride would have leveled out the additional cost to stay at the full-service property. Overall, the staff was kind and gracious, the hotel was clean and accommodating, just dated and out of the way a bit. Would I stay here again Probably not but it did meet our needs for the one night stay.I appreciate you taking the time to write a thoughtful review -- it was a pleasure hosting you prior to your cruise. I'm glad we could provide a comfortable place for you to rest while you explored the city during your short stay. That said, it's a shame your room didn't meet your expectations. We're always happy to provide extra plates and cutlery should you require them. As for the bed set, I'm sorry about the confusion. You should have been brought and blanket, and I apologize that wasn't the case. All in all, thank you very much for leaving a review. The team and I hope to welcome you back again one day. -Frank F., General Manager",

                "text": "I do quite a bit of travelling and this has to be one of the best value one can get for Seattle. Perfect for families or extended business travel. An excellent staff that aims to please, a downtown location, extra large rooms, and the better than average breakfast....you can't go wrong.Staff. Each and everyone sent their best with a greeting: all the valets, each and every front desk clerk, 2 house persons, and the breakfast staff. Service is top notch and this means management is doing a great job.Large Rooms. The suite had an extra large living room with a sofa that can seat four. A small kitchenette was equipped with a frig and a microwave oven. The bathroom set up was convenient as the sink is outside the bath for functionality. The queen bed was firm and I had the best sleep of the entire week. It is downtown so you have the usual downtown noise but I did not find it bothersome.Downtown location. Convenient freeway access. It is literally a turn and a stop light away from the on ramp to I-5. Across the street was a Subway restaurant and 24 Hour Fitness. Across the corner was a good size Starbucks. Within 5 to 10 minute walk are your downtown selection of cafes, thai food, pizza places and more.Breakfast. I think this property offered just little bit more than the competition when it came to selection. You have 2 types of scrambled eggs, 3 types of meat (Canadian bacon, sausage, and ham), a wider selection of pastries, a few types of breads, oatmeal and cereal, multi juice dispenser, jams/jellies. I was also able to build a cold sandwich with ham and 2 different kinds of cheese. You can also make your peanut butter or nutella sandwich. The staff also bused and cleaned the table after each patron.Fitness facility. There was a pool but I didn't see anyone using it. I saw the staff maintained it daily. The gym was smallish but adequate. It had 2 treadmills, one elliptical, good selection of weights, a weight bench, towels, exercise mat, and a water fountain.Other amenities. Bath amenities were Paul Mitchell. WiFi was strong in the room, lobby and restaurant. You had 2 desktops for internet or printing boarding passes. I appreciated the lobby offerings of coffee, tea, and infused water dispenser.Cons. Some nuances: it is a bit dated but still well maintained. The WiFi seemed to drop off while I was at the Gym. I did not see an exercise ball. I can see where some folks may have issues with the noise being close to the freeway and downtown. I didn't have this issue but perhaps one can ask for earplugs. I was in Astoria, Oregon where the seals nearby bothered some guests and the hotel offered earplugs.I think this Springhill Suite by Marriott is definitely the best value one can score in downtown Seattle. I would highly recommend and definitely will return given a chance.Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your visit! We're thrilled you enjoyed everything form the large suites to all of our many amenities. You can always count on us for friendly and attentive service -- our mission is to do whatever we can to ensure you have a comfortable stay. We appreciate you recommending us, and we hope to welcome you back the next time you're in Seattle.Take care, Frank F., General Manager",

                "text": "I stayed for a combination business/vacation trip with my parents. The location was convenient to the highway, but a long (if doable) walk to the main Seattle attractions. The lobby was nice. Breakfast was good, and the breakfast staff was nice. The room itself was pretty mediocre. I noticed mold in the bathroom, and the carpets were old. The room could have used more storage/drawers for clothing and personal items. Front desk staff was pretty bad. They didn't seem particularly willing help me when asked. My parents stayed a few days later and had terrible customer service from a front desk employee, so that has further detracted from my opinion of the hotel. I would not stay here again.I'm very sorry to hear about your disappointment with our service, Christina. That's not the experience we strive to provide our guests, so I'll be looking into what went wrong during your stay so it doesn't happen again.Regards,Frank F., General Manager",

The lobby is very modern and comfy, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is one of the best free dining experiences I have had. 4 hot items in addition to standard cold breakfast fare, they even have Nutella. Sometimes when you travel, it's about the small things and a pile of bacon just hit that spot.It's awesome all of our amenities put us above and beyond other places you've stayed, Liz! I'm happy to hear even our small details, like Nutella at breakfast, impressed you. Looking forward to hosting you again when you're in Seattle!Until then,Frank F., General Manager",

                "text": "This is a real nice Spring Hill Suites. The front counter staff is very well trained I left some suite cases here for a week as I was traveling around Washington when asked the front counter staff if I could do this Absolutely I said they are kind of large not a problem. The next morning when I went to leave them I explained to the lady the gentleman said I could leave them and shes like of course no one said let me get the manager let me see etc. etc. just an empowered staff to satisfy guests. I also had problem with the HVAC system upon check in they sent maintenance up within 10min could not correct the problem he apologized for the inconvenience and that I needed to go back down to the front desk to switch rooms, again front counter staff apologizing and the gentleman looked hard for the closest room on the same floor and finds one two doors down.As for other things the bar is good, great prices for hotel bar and do not remember ever seeing one in a Spring Hill Suites, breakfast is a little above average for this grade of hotel. Rooms for Spring Hill are on par and about what you would expect. Location is good depending where youre walking if you dont mind walking an extra 4-5 blocks from where immediate downtown hotels are to places like Pikes Place it is fine it is also a lot closer to what I think they call the area capitol hill again you need to be ok with walking since you walk up a big hill about three blocks and youre in a great area with many restaurants and bars and no tourists.You also get free use of 24hr. fitness across the street and internet. I did not have a car but think they charge for parking so just beware to calculate that in your budget. Would stay again when in Seattle.",

Suites are a large room with a short (4 ft) divider. There were lots of AC outlets including on lamps on the desk and 2 near the bed . Internet speed was excellent, averaging 5Mb/sec. Pricing is lower if you stay 5 days.The hotel has a small pool and exercise room. 24hr fitness, with lots of machines and weights is across the street and free to guests. Staff is happy, friendly and helpful.Breakfast was surprisingly good. Eggs were real, with cereal, fresh fruit, oatmeal, yogurt and pastries. Coffee and Tea (Bigelow bags) are served 24/7. Best of all, the hot water didn't taste like coffee! Dinner was just OK. There are better choices in the area.Location: Off I-5, but takes 10-15 min (in rush hr) due to one-way streets/traffic. Immediate exit onto I-5. It is a 12 min walk from the Airport train. It is not downtown, but it's close (15-20 min). The Space needle and museum complex is about a 15 min walk. The neighborhood to the northwest is full of newly constructed apartments, plus many cafes and upscale restaurants. There is a whole foods (7 min walk) with a huge deli/bakery/salad bar if you want something cheap easy, but no nearby convenience store. (Don't miss Market House on Howell for corned beef!) Walk east across I-5 (up Denny Olive)) and you'll find funkier neighborhoods and parks, plus cheaper (and excellent) eateries. There are many homeless people and panhandlers in the area west of the hotel. The Pikes Market/waterfront is 15-20 min on foot. A giant REI is a block away and worth visiting. It's also the non-hotel food in the evening.Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed review -- these kinds of tips are always helpful for our newer guests. It sounds like you were able to see a lot of the city while you were in town. Hope you'll consider us for your next trip to Seattle!All the best,Frank F., General Manager",

The sleek lobby with fireplace is spacious and provides several areas for conversation and an adjacent lobby bar is a busy spot to watch a game on TV or get a bite to eat. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful especially when we wanted to mail packages home. The efficient valets were on the ball every minute to store/retrieve your car (22.00/night), flag a cab, or arrange a shuttle to the downtown areas. Luggage carts are available at the point of entry. The engineer of the hotel offered to fix our luggage handle which was broken by the airline and it was done in minutes, cheerfully! The rooms are very spacious, the desk is roomy and has a good work light and even the desk chair was comfortable on rolling castors. Earth tones of grey and soft green walls were subdued and restful. Comfortable bed, above average linens and lots of great pillows. Sitting area had two floor lamps and was very ample with a nice firm sofa and two chairs. Everything was clean and updated, spotless sink area and toilet/bath room. Despite its location near the interstate our room was quiet. The daily breakfasts in the dining room were a full-service hot buffet for an additional nominal fee, efficient, welcoming staff, and no waiting. The Springhill Suites staff seems genuinely happy to serve patrons and we are appreciative for their helpfulness and suggestions, making this hotel feel like a home away from home.Reviews like this absolutely make my day -- there's nothing better than to hear we could be a bright spot and a comfort while someone was on the road.

It is about 30 minutes walk to Pier 66, from where boats go to Canada, about 10 minutes to Space Needle and about 20 minutes to Pike Market. So, very good location in that sence. However, the surrounding area is a business type location, so it does not look very attractive at night. I did not walk outside past 7pm, day time and mornings were fine though.The hotel has shuttle that takes you to Space Needel, West Lake shopping mall (4 block from there to Pike Market) and to conference center. All driving times are 5 minutes, if not less.Comfortable rooms, very very spacious. Small bathrooms though, but the sink and mirror were outside of the bathroom, so it was ok. Big screen TV. excellent AC unit, easy to use (unlike in many hotels) and really really QUITE! I have never stayed in a hotel with such a quite AC unit. My room did face the freeway, you do hear the noise but it is somewhat muffled so it did not bother me at all.I am not sure if anyone stayed in adjecent rooms, but i heard nothing at all during the entire stay (4 nights)good breakfast included in room rate, the variety stays the same, but I would not complain since there was not additional charge. There is also coffee/tea service in the lobby all day.The hotel has a bar that serves food, it was good and the pricing was nice.Bathroom amenities are of good quality.The indoor pool is really small, i would compare it with the pool for kids accompanied by adult. The water seemed somewhat chilly to me during the stay, although it was heated to 81 degrees according to thermometer.Complimentary business center, did not use internet in room, so cant write about connection speed etc...front desk is friendly, knowledgebale, very helpful so are shuttle drivers. The hotel has umbrellas, so you can get one from bell stand if you forgot yours.parking is expensive, right next door is an open parking for a free less then hotel however based on the non-attractiveness of the surronding area I would park with the hotel, just to be safe, even if its going to be just a few more extra",

Once we checked in , our toilet in the room had blood stuck to the ring. Now after complaining, we got moved and credited points.. so that was a plus. It was about a 10-15 Uber/Lyft ride to the main areas. STaff was nice, bartender was awesome, and the upgrade was helpful. I would not stay there again based on proximity.Miranda, I appreciate you writing us. We work very hard to make sure our guests get to and from our hotel in a quick and safe manner. Though, at times, traffic can impede our abilities. I'm glad we were able to move you into a more comfortable room. We're happy to offer guests the convenience of a shuttle to central attractions.

Some would not like the noise, The breakfast room was woefully inadequate to hold guests compounded by the fact that guests would not clean up after them. Hotel out of the center of city but did run a shuttle to the down town and space needle on the hour. Does have a guest laundry.Good Day Rowan T,Thank you for the review.

                "text": "Location: I was there on business and my meetings were very close to this hotel. The location is great if your office is nearby. Downtown was close, location wise, this place was great for me.Room: I stayed in the executive suite and I believe the website said this room can accommodate 5 people. I really doubt that, with a queen size bed, one long couch and little room to place extra mattresses, I would really doubt that this is capable of fitting in 5 people. The rate was exorbitant as well, I understand it was close to the US open and cruise season but was definitely very costly for such a suite. Definitely scored low on the value for money bit. I may have come in at a busy time. Lost one star on account of this.The room itself was nice enough. the view was okay. Office buildings on one side and the highway on the other. Comfortable bed and clean linen.Noise levels: I did not find it particularly noisy even though my room was next to the roads. Service: Service was decent as well. One of the days, however, I returned to my room with my door left open, blocked by the door stopper. That was unsettling, especially given that they don't have a safe in the room as well. Breakfast was included and it was average. Scrambled eggs, hash browns, pan cakes . The usual stuff really. Nothing to write home about. The breakfast area can get crowded in the mornings. They ask you to sit at the individual seats near the bar during breakfast which is fine if you are alone but with family, you may not get the tables you want.They place some tasty treats in the floor lobby in the mornings and evenings. That is a nice touch and at times better than the actual breakfast. Apparently, they do it only on the exec room floors though.The room service and reception are responsive and helpful. Other pros: They have a subway bang opposite. They also give you access to a 24hour fitness gym that is opposite as well. Would I come here again Very much so, primarily because I am likely to visit Seattle on business and it is extremely close to my offices.Would I come here with my family I doubt it. Doesn't quite make that cut.Dear GowriShankarTS,Thanks for the comprehensive review of our hotel. We are so glad you would stay with us again. We look forward to serving as your host when business brings you back.Sincerely,",

Can't comment on the breakfast because we missed it (came down too late and when they say that breakfast ends at 9 a.m., they mean it. The food is whisked away, so don't be late! The hotel bar is comfortable has a TV screen that may not be huge, but it is big enough that you and a few friends can gather there to watch the playoff games. It may not be right in the heart of downtown Seattle, but it is within walking distance to the top attractions (Pike's Place, Space Needle, the big department stores, etc. -- and most of that is downhill from the hotel.) Plus, the hotel offers a shuttle that runs to and from the downtown area. Bottom line -- we would stay there again.Sounds perfect -- glad you got to enjoy just about everything here and around us!

I've been staying here just about every week for the last 9 months, and they still blackout corporate rates every chance they get. They refuse to honor customer loyalty, and make booking rooms here consistently impossible. They like to charge you more for the executive level, which is a load of garbage because they're just rooms at the top of the hotel with free cereal and water bottles. I'll be glad when I don't have to stay at this property anymore, just because of how difficult they make the booking process. I've had to stay outside the city and drive over 1 hour each way because they refuse to honor corporate rates at random times. The staff isn't great. it's almost like they have this attitude that they're a top of the line luxury hotel in Seattle, which isn't the case. Definitely wouldn't recommend this property to business travelers. If you're a family and can throw down some serious cash for an unimpressive hotel in a crappy part of town then go for it.Dear bpcole,I am so sorry that you were dissatisfied with your stay. Please contact us directly at the hotel. We can further discuss your experience. You may call us at 206 254 0500. Ask for the Manager on duty and we will be happy to try to make it right.Regards,",

Check-in was a breeze and the booking was all as requested.We had a King suite and my friend said the sofa bed was comfortable to get a good night's sleep. We had to call the front desk as the sofa did not have any bedding on it - they were in a cupboard and someone came immediately to help us. My bed was comfortable.The cupboard s somewhat smallish but plenty of coat hangers.The bathroom was a good size and functional and it was nice to have a basin/sink in a separate area outside the bathroom. Amenities included separate shampoo and conditioner, as well as soap and body wash. The towels were a good size, but a couple of them had a musty smell - fortunately there were extra towels.But the breakfast - what a wonderful surprise - hot buffet breakfast each morning included with the rate, and coffee constantly available in the lobby.And Wall Street Journal available each morning.We walked everywhere. Yes, there is a shuttle but we did not need to catch it. Walked to Pike Market, Pioneer Place, Space Neede and Lake. Great easy walking. Yes that are some are sow folks who are own on their luck - but this is a downtown city area. Watch yourself. Had someone who was follwing us but this was in the Pioneer Place area.Went on a great tour, Bill Spiedel's Underground tour - highly recommend for the history, and a number of great galleries for North West art.Had booked an early morning wake up call ad a car to take me to the airport. The call did not happen but fortunately I had set my alarm as well, but the car was there which was the mre important issue. Great car service the hotel uses and they take credit cards.I also had room service and recommend the salmon burger - the salmon was great, and the asparagus soup was very tasty. Room service was very prompt and order was as requested.Be aware there s quite a hefty room tax (presumably paid to the city), so it turns a 160 room into over 200 - not the hotel's fault, but be aware as I was surprised by the additional taxes being so high.Overall, a wonderful stay and would stay here again if I came to Seattle.Greetings AussieNarelle! Thank you for your feeback. We are happy that you were happy with your stay with us. Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! (I hope you are actually Australian!) Cheers!",

Based on the reviews, I knew that the hotel itself was pretty good, but I wasn't sure to expect in terms of its location.First off, the room itself is great. It was clean and spacious, which is good considering we were three adults in the room. There is a bit of noise to be heard from the highway at night, and while i'm not used to the sounds of passing cars when I sleep, I had no problem sleeping with this. I felt the water pressure in the showerhead is softer than what i'm used to, but again, it's not a big deal.The lobby is going through a bit of renovations, but is still a nice area. The buffet breakfast is great. Lots of different things to choose from and they even provide little bags or to-go packaging if you want to take any foods upstairs with you.All the staff we encountered were very warm and friendly, and we were always greeted whenever we saw someone.As for location, the hotel is not exactly in the heart of downtown, but it's easily accessible. It is a 20min straight-line walk to Pike Place Market (with a gentle up and down slope), and shorter if you're just hitting the shops. Of course, the hotel offers a free shuttle that leaves every hour to a few stops within the city and you make arrangements beforehand. So my big worry about the hotel's location was really not a big deal at all.I would have no problems choosing to stay here again in the future.",

I was on the odd-numbered rooms which do not appear to face the freeway, so I did not hear traffic noise.The complimentary continental breakfast had bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, breads, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereals, etc. Not bad for complimentary continental breakfast.Overall, it was an okay stay. Maybe spending 5 days in similarly priced hotels in Vancouver and Victoria Canada raised my expectations and the Springhill Suites did not compare favorably to those in Canada.",

The breakfast was hot and the staff was attentive and making sure that all dishes were filled promptly. The room was comfortable - basic, but spacious for our night.

I would suggest looking at a map before heading out around town. There is a free shuttle provided by the hotel to the two major attractions in town (pike's place market and the space needle), but instead of waiting we just walked. Not many restaurants near the hotel, but many a short 15 minute walk away. We stayed at the hotel for one night before departing on a cruise. It was perfect for that short of a trip. I would definitely recommend the SpringHill Suites to anyone looking for a slightly larger hotel room at a reasonable rate.So glad you could check us out while you were in Seattle! I hope you enjoyed your cruise. It sounds like you got to do a little sightseeing before you left, and I'm happy the market and the Space Needle made your list. Good note about the shuttle, by the way -- it's always available if you need it, but walking is a great way to see the city, too. Until next time,Frank F., General Manager",

We felt it would be ok because we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in our room but after not sleeping for 2 nights because of the noise I wished we had requested a different room.The area is VERY seedy, even in the day time. Just next door is an area where people gathered to do drugs and just hang out. We were very nervous walk around the area at night. We witnessed people shooting up in broad day light. We seemed to be in their territory.We attempted the shuttle to the ball game, it was leaving 2 hours pre game so we opted to call a taxi that didn't come. Luckily we were able to flag a cab a block away and just made it in time for the beginning of the game.Staff was accomodating, valet was great, breakfast was ok, better than most hotels with free breakfast.familyofthreexyy,Thank you for choosing Springhill Suites Seattle Downtown and for sharing your comments regarding your recent stay.

Reading other reviews, I laugh at comments about it's location since you should probably look at a hotel's address in relation to where you are going before you book Free breakfast and Wifi were excellent. Kids watched Netflix nightly which I can't say is possible in every hotel. Pool is dated and heavily chlorinated with cheap stuff that makes your eyes burn. Goggles are a must for the kids. When we booked this hotel, it shows up as a category 7 for rewards which his hilarious (equivalent to Maui) so I used my corporate rate which saved us about 100/night over closer hotels. We had planned on using Uber, but found out that the FREE hotel shuttle would drop/pickup at the Space Needle and Westlake Mall. From Westlake, it's a few more blocks to Pikes Market, but like most Americans I need the exercise :) If you are on vacation and unless you need a car to go outside of downtown/waterfront Seattle, I would advise on ditching it at one of the nearby locations and save the 26/day valet.Free breakfast and Wi-Fi always make for the start of a great stay, especially when youre visiting a city, Mike. Thats why we make sure you can begin each day full and connected. Were also all about providing that free shuttle to take you to those popular Seattle spots. Keep us in mind next time youre in the city!Safe travels,Frank F., General Manager",

                "text": "IntroductionAs I looked out over Interstate 5 from my hotel room during rush hour, I felt somewhat justified in heeding the advice of more than a few Seattleites, who warned of the citys congested roadways, and voted in favor of its public transit alternatives. Allow me to draw the curtains, however, because this isnt about the sights and sounds of Seattle (lovely though it was), but of the Springhill Suites, Marriotts 3-star offering located at 1800 Yale Avenue.ItineraryThe original plan was to take the link light rail from SeaTac airport all the way to Westlake Station, where I could then walk to my hotel of choice, the Westin. Since I had 50,000 Marriott Rewards points to spend, and would rather graduate to a 4-star hotel later in the week, I slightly altered the itinerary. After arriving and walking to the Westin, I found a taxi out front that whisked us (my girlfriend and I) nine blocks or so to the Springhill Suites. I believe the total cost of that trip was 7, including a tip. This was a somewhat nerve racking experience, as I wasnt sure how we would get to the hotel up until that point. More on that later.Lobby and Front DeskUpon entering the lobby, there were a few things to note. First and foremost the friendly staff, who provided room keys and a voucher for a complimentary item from their snack bar (or 200 Marriott Rewards points), all while addressing me with a proper title and a smile. I know its their job, but Im a sucker for hearing my last name preceded by Mr.. The complimentary snack may have been a result of my status with Marriott (due to the points or my Marriott Rewards credit card). On the way to the elevators I glanced over at the bar/restaurant (appropriately titled Bistro on Yale Bar) and examined a lively scene of music and people that seemed to reflect the younger culture of Seattle. What I mean is that a large portion of the people I encountered throughout the city were either younger or around my age (Im 27 at the time of this review). Room Location and ViewThe view was nice, and about what I would expect from a 3-star hotel. It was located on the 8th floor, and Im not sure if this was to satisfy some preferred floor requisite in accordance with my entry level membership status. If so, it seemed strange that I was located next to the elevator and on the side without the coveted view of the space needle (like Id seen advertised). I wonder if Gold or Platinum status is necessary to net these luxuries without question, or a simple request to the front desk accompanied by 20. My view looked down on the 1811 Eastlake Avenue housing project, but also included the REI building, another building that displayed the time and temperature (very helpful when dressing), and the freeway. The first of these was the most interesting, where I viewed two men casually smoking marijuana on the back patio (kind of a site when youre from one of the 46 contiguous states that have not legalized it).Room AmenitiesThe room itself appeared well kept and clean on entry. The peripheral furniture included a couch that turned into a fold-out, and a chair both were on the lower end of comfortable, but I wasnt expecting Hancock and Moore. As advertised, the room also included a mini refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and sink all the basics for an extended stay. They even threw in a few packets of tea and coffee (including decaf). Across from the kitchenette, and probably my favorite part of the whole room, was the office area. The desk was roomy enough to accommodate my laptop, power adapter, a few snacks, and the host of other things that had accumulated in my pockets throughout the day. The power socket on the lamp was also a simple yet appreciated feature. The best part, and the reason Ive wallowed on the office area this long, was the chair. I found myself able to sit for at least forty-five minutes comfortably. I wish I could say the same for the bed, which was a little too firm for my taste. After 8.5 hours of searching for the perfect position, the first morning was a little hazy. This restlessness wasnt limited to sleep, but also occurred while keeping my head at an 11:00 position to watch the televisionoddly situated in the space between the living area and bedroom. I see why they had to put it there, as the wall that led into the bedroom slanted inward into the bathroom area, but it still makes you wonder why the room was built this way. Speaking of, the toilet and shower were in a room across from the mirror and sink. A little peculiar, but both areas were clean. The hotel was also kind enough to purchase swiveling televisions (plasma, 32-inch) to partially accommodate for the strange viewing angles. As I collapsed on to the fold out (yes, the fold out) after my first full day of touring, I questioned whether the floors consistency would be preferable to the charismatic springs in my back. Surprisingly, I slept better on this coiled chassis than the real bed. I can only assume it was due to the quality of the comforter (dense and fluffy), my exhaustion from the night before, and the vast amount of walking that took place earlier in the day. Local AreaYou know the saying about real estate, and so does Marriott. Though 1800 Yale Avenue isnt in the heart of the city, the area in which its built has a distinct urban vibe that still offers plenty of comfort. I like convenience while traveling, so seeing a Subway across the street was a welcome assurance after a half-day spent walking around Microsofts campus. I did frequent this establishment more than once, but lest anyone accuse me of not absorbing the local food culture, I assure there was an undeniable flavor about the stores setup that merited multiple visits. The main eating area was quite large, to the point you could probably fit three to four regular-sized Subways in the space. There was also a hallway connecting this area to another equally-sized one (minus the ordering counter). Seating options varied from booths to round-tables (think Starbucks) and stool-tables. Also impressive was the lit fireplace near the round table I selected, which actually kept me warm. Come to find out, this space had been renovated by the owner to accommodate a local online retailer who would be occupying a number of floors above it in the future (you know them as Amazon). There was also a 24-Hour Fitness next door to Subway (and still across the street from the hotel). Nothing special there, except the complimentary guest access in addition to Springhill Suites own, smaller fitness room. This included the weight room and cardio areas, as well as the locker rooms and associated amenities. If weights or cardio arent your thing, the pool, sauna or steam room may still be worth checking out. The ShuttleBesides a room, what else did the Springhill Suites have to offer Did someone say free shuttle! But to whereand when I learned the answer to these two questions the hard way as I stood outside of Nordstroms after arriving at Westlake Center, overwhelmed by the incredible fall weather (central Texas gave up on the concept years ago). As much as I wanted to see Marriotts safe insignia whirl around the corner and transport me free of charge, the hotel representative I spoke with informed that the bus only ran until 9:00 PM. We had arrived at Westlake around 9:45, so we strolled among the yellowed leaves to the Westin for a taxi. **fast forward to the day of checkout** I glanced down from my window at the back alley, where I spotted the shuttle bus with its hood open. The driver was pouring fluid into one of the tanks, but I couldnt make out which fluid or tank. I consulted the front desk thirty minutes later to redeem a free shuttle ride back to Westlake Center, but was informed the bus was undergoing an oil change. I looked out the back window again to discover the hood had been closed and the driver had vanished. They called me a cab instead, and offered to refund the fare. I guess what Im trying to say is, I have no idea what the shuttle is like! All I can say is it exists, and it travels to Westlake Center and Seattle Center (according to the front desk patron). Food and DrinkOne of the sweeter alternative rock bands said, Some people drink Pepsi, some people drink Coke. In this hotel the assumption is the former, and you will find their vending machines on most floors (I checked while looking for a working ice machine), as well as at the front snack bar. This drove my girlfriend nuts since she avidly consumes Diet Coke, and contributed to the aforementioned Subway visits. Im not sure if the the bar or breakfast area had alternatives, because I never went or had orange juice, respectively. Speaking of juice, the continental breakfast included eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, cereal, fruit, and an assortment of pastries. It was all pretty standard, and while Im not versed in the culinary arts, I would rate the Hampton Inn or Embassy Suites a notch higher in quality. Still, free breakfast works for me! Business CenterLets delve into whats often thought of as the lobbys forgotten extension. This is the place that excites me most, partly because of my selected profession (IT), and partly because of my general curiosity about how its handled. Before I get too entrenched, Id like to note that the wireless network in my room was open and unencrypted. A few questions entered my mind about thislike what would stop anyone in the area from leeching off the networkor anyone with a little technical sense from stirring up mischief (and by mischief I mean remotely browsing through your stuff) The possibilities are truly endless, and I would be remiss if I didnt urge you to get your digital house in order before connecting to this network (or any others like it).We can start with a basic question, something along the lines of What does the business center offer Well, there are two desktop computers and a printer, so you could check-in for your flight or print your boarding pass. Maybe you need to print out tickets for a local attraction or event. In some cases, you might even need to make an emergency purchase (pizza delivery if Subway is closed). That last situation brings up another questionthe one about feeling safe enough to enter your credit card number. While I did perform an extensive preliminary analysis to determine if vulnerabilities existed, the thing that probably concerns you most is the safety of your information. It should be stated that information is never 100 private, and with enough ingenuity and time anyone can probably get to it (obvious lecture concluded). Lucky for us, most people looking for a free lunch just dont want to work that hard. For those few criminal masterminds, however, dont make it easy!To give a brief overview, I was able to turn on cached internet files, history, auto-fill, and form data in Internet Explorer and Firefox. While there was a program for detecting spyware (Spybot), there was no antivirus program present. I was also able to successfully boot from a live USB, which can potentially undermine many of the security measures put in place by Windows 7 (their OS of choice). On the plus side the firewall was on, the user account was not an administrator by default, and a program called Deep Freeze was installedwhich presumably removes all cached files between sessions. While some of these measures are good, it only takes one gaping hole to gain complete control of a machine. If there were a bottom line, it would be that personal or financial usage of these machines could make it easy.Fitness CenterNot too far down the hall exists the hotels own fitness center and swimming pool. I cant say much for the pool or hot tub since I didnt use them, but the fitness center contained two decent LifeFitness treadmills, one bike, one elliptical machine, and some free dumbbell weights. If the hustle and bustle (and meatheads) of the gym are too much for you, this modest area could be the perfect retreat to satisfy your cardiovascular or weight lifting needs. I would also like to note that right outside the fitness center is the nicest mens bathroom in the whole hotel. I said mens bathroom! I wont go into detail, but at this rate I imagine the womens restroom is actually a spa.Cleaning ServiceBefore leaving the Springhill Suites to downtown Seattles friendly, urban borders, lets talk about one last thing. While coming and going throughout our stay the staff were extremely pleasant, from the front desk clerks to the breakfast chefs. Even the maid was polite and cheery, something I found amazing. One strange thing, however, was that for the entire two-night stay no one cleaned our room. Im aware that some hotels offer a green option, where you choose not to have someone come in and clean in exchange for something like rewards points. To my knowledge this is not one of those hotels. We did hang a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, but removed it when we left each morning. It wasnt a huge deal (as were relatively clean people), but I imagine this could be an issue for say, a family of four with kids.ConclusionOverall I enjoyed my stay at the Springhill Suites, and would probably return if looking for a decent, 3-star hotel in one of Seattles interesting pockets. In case Subway and business centers dont pique your interest (I cant imagine), below are a few bullet points to consider: Pros:Friendly, professional staffNice view from eighth floor (out of ten)Room clean on entryExtended stay appliancesComfortable office chairDecent locationSubway across the streetFull complimentary access to 24-Hour Fitness ( also across the street)Free shuttleComplimentary continental breakfastFree Internet/printerQuieter, on-site fitness centerCons:Limited shuttle hoursVery firm bedOdd placement of televisionThin fold out bed with springy mattressPepsi-only propertyOpen, unencrypted wifiBusiness center machines potential for ID/financial theftRoom never cleaned throughout stayDear Ryan C,Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to complete a review of our property.

The hot breakfast in the morning is a great convenience prior to heading to business. The price per room per night is great if you don't mind walking a bit.thefoodlover1001,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts on your most recent stay at SpringHill Suites Seattle Downtown.

The neighborhood is very residential and in a no-honk zone which makes it quiet. This is about the only good thing about the hotelHotel: The hotel can't even really be called a hotel. It's a youth hostel without an age restriction. In each room you get a bed, a small TV a mirror and a sink. That's it! You have to leave a deposit at the front desk for sheets and they are not the cleanest in the world. The bathrooms are shared. Each bathroom has a toilet and a shower. Imagine how long it takes for you to wait to do your business in the morning! The lifts are ancient and slow. The front desk could really care less about you being there.The only reason we booked this hotel was because we needed to get to New York on the cheap for my wife to audition for the show Project Runway. There was some other even going on at the time and hotel prices were 3X what they usually go for. For 100 a night, we weren't expecting much. I think that I would have felt ripped off at 20.Stay away...stay FAR FAR away!",

There were only about 10 channels on the TV and nothing for kids (so I had no pool or TV for the first night after a long day of work and traveling). But the hotel is close to a shopping center and not too far from UTEP so it worked well for what we needed.",

I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot.",

What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!",

Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a \"sewer\" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.) One evening, I decided to use the hot tub outside (because I was rather cold and knew I couldn't take a hot shower). The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out.",

I then used my cell phone to call the front desk directly and they immediately picked up! I was quite upset at this point. They said they would send security to check on the noisy room. Security eventually showed up, and knocked on the wrong room! Needless to say I had to call back and finally persuaded them to switch me to a different room. So at around 2 am, there we are getting all of our stuff packed up again to switch rooms, as soon as we enter the next room, I walk up to the window and find a drone right in front of it peering in!

Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!",

Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself.

I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more.

The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great!

A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep.",

It didn't keep me up at night, but it was noticeable. Some good things to make sure you don't think it was all bad: *The hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, had great food, and it provided good room service AND it was the first time I'd seen room service at a reasonable price. *The hotel is right on the beach, and since it's not in the crowded part of VA beach shore, there's not so many other people to deal with. Also, the hotel is on the shore of VB that is in the Chesapeake Bay, so the water is much calmer than the beach along Atlantic Avenue something to consider if you have young children.",

She then, goes get a manager who had gotten everything taken care of but didn't apologize on their end. After going through that (holding up the line because she was the only one working) she then tells us that the computer was down so she couldn't issue us room keys. We asked what were we supposed to do She said that she would send house keeping to out floor to let us in. House keeping even struggled to get in had to get another person to open the door. Finally, enter the room checked it thoroughly. Room was dusty bathroom sink was clogged when I washed my hands. Take a shower later on, and water leaked all over bathroom floor. Checked back 3 hours later for the room keys she told us the machine was still down so we had to wait an additional hour or so. Upon check out the next morning, a different young lady ask how was our stay, I explained briefly our experience.

                "text": "We enjoyed our stay at this establishment. The king size room was very comfortable, the bedding and mattress type in particular. One aspect of the room that I thoroughly appreciated was the ability to control the climate. In many hotels the thermostats are locked out at a certain temperature depending upon the time of the year. At this hotel you could control the cool air or heat at your discretion (major kudos...). Unfortunately a complaint was lodged with housekeeping because a specific request was made to have the sheets changed (on second day of 3 night stay), and although the request was eagerly granted, the bed linen was not changed. Upon a late return to the hotel we made another request to have the bed linen changed. The service desk accommodated us as best as they could (at 1130p) but our sheets did not get changed until 1245a when the overnight attendant came on duty. This all could have been avoided had the housekeeping receptionist paid actual attention to my request instead of merely giving me lip service. The hotel manager took excellent steps in addressing my concerns. I would definitely stay at this hotel upon future travel. Thank You!",

Very modern room and hotel. Our room had a door, that conjoined to the neighboring room...this was the only flaw. I'm unsure if it was because of the conjoining door or thin walls, but we could hear everything they said and was a bit uneasy knowing they could hear us too. The hotel offers a continental breakfast. It was mediocre, like they all are. The setup was very nice and very clean. We didn't park at the hotel, 35 a night, instead we parked at the rear of the hotel. It was 3 a night in the public parking garage. This hotel is walking distance to Fells Point, Harbor East, Little Italy, and Inner Harbor. It is also under a 10 cab ride to Power Plant.",

They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle.

However, I was disappointed with the service in Linthicum, MD during our stay. I did not feel the front desk was friendly or had smiles. I hate dealing with customer service that you feel you are inconveniencing. If you have kids that stay with you on the fold-out couch, they never have extra bedding in the room, if you want to make up the bed. We asked the front desk for the extra bedding. It wasn't provided. We called housekeeping. No answer. We called the desk, and eventually housekeeping brought up extra towels. Eventually, housekeeping brought up some bedding with a repeat call to the desk. The next morning their was no receipt on the floor by your door like most hotels. Because we didn't just wanted to go in the morning, after our yummy breakfast (during which mindful busboys kept our table clear of extra, now emptied dishes), we just wanted to pack up and leave without stopping by the desk. This was probably a big mistake, because I found out the next weekend, that the Linthicum charged us for the room on top of what I already paid hotels.com. That was incredibly annoying. What if never had checked my account. Could this have happened at another time, at one of their other locations Thankfully, a call to the polite desk supervisor took care of it for us. We're supposed to get a credit in a few days.",

The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.",

The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.",

Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff. I would wipe it clean and start with a brand new clean slate... With everything.",

However, there were a couple of problems with our room. We stayed in room 120 for two nights. First, when we entered the room we were all struck by a kind of damp feeling and ammonia smell. I thought it was just cleaning fluid and our noses did adjust in a few minutes. However, upon reentering the room each time the smell was always there and did not go away. Additionally, paper left in the room got that kind of damp feel about it where it goes a little limp, and wet clothes hung up upon our arrival were still damp two days later, even though the air conditioner was on the whole time. Theres almost certainly water collecting somewhere in the room causing the ammonia smell and damp feeling. Its worth noting that the air conditioner was new and quiet and worked fine, and I wouldnt have suspected any problem. However, my suspicion is that it was set to recirculate or perhaps the drain was clogged, or both. I looked for a recirculate control on the A/C, but couldnt find one. Either that or theres a plumbing leak somewhere in the room, though I saw no sign of it. I reported this to the clerk on checkout. The other problem is that the tub drain was misaligned with tub floor and would not close properly, so it was impossible to take a tub bath. The clerk offered to switch our room, but it was not worth the trouble since we were checking out soon.",

The second room had a roach in it so again we asked to change. We weren't taking any chances because if there is one roach there may be more. Finally, the third room was great. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station, mall, and diner. The hotel shuttle was great also. There were many options during breakfast. We received small gifts from the hotel during our stay such as goody bags and treats. It was really nice to come back after being away from the hotel and find something special left in the room.

Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back.",

If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers.",

I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!! I have never received such wonderful customer service during any hotel stay as I did at the Hilton Garden Inn.

When I went to check in there was first a delay because the customer in front of me room was not ready. Then I found out my room wasn't ready. I was asked to leave my so they could call me when it was. They suggested I go drive around until then with gas prices so high. We came back at 5 pm and the room still wasn't ready. We sat in the hot car for another hour before they finally just offered us two single rooms instead of the queen double we prepaid for, stating they sold out of those rooms. We lost a whole day of our vacation simply b/c we weren't able to check-in until nearly 4 hours after the stated time. We didnt get to the beach until late so my kids only got tospend about an hour in the water. Check-out was no better. It was supposed to be at noon, but a male housekeeper came into my room at 1130 without knocking ready to turn the room over. Luckily I wasn't indisposed or anything. Then, the front desk tried to charge me a second time for the room. The room was nice, however. I would have considered staying thre again if those things didn't happen.",

I took them up on the offer and would have thought the room they put me in would have been checked first, but yep you guessed it...ants again (in February and on a completely different floor)! I think it's time they called an exterminator! They moved me to a different room, but offered nothing else. Won't go back.",

Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",

It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.) Overall, this place was great.",

It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable.",

Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that! It was my son's first time to D.C. thank you for making it a great trip.",

The Verizon Center was not far at all. I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful. It was in a great location to restaurants and DC and I would absolutely stay here again.",

First on our first night we attempted to order room service which was supposed to be available 24/7 however after letting the phone ring for over five minutes without any one answering.... Twice we tried calling the concierge and got the same lack of response so we gave up and went to bed hungry. The other issue was with the shower. The water pressure from the bath tub faucet was fine and the water was hot but on e you switched it to shower there was so little flow that it would take forever to rinse shampoo out of your hair. I eventually resorted to switching back to the bathtub faucet and used one of the glasses to rinse my hair filing it from the bathtub faucet. The next night I decided I would just take a bath instead of standing in the sprinkle of the shower however the bathtub stopper would not deal off enough to even get more than 1 inch of water in the tub. To get by I used that came glass to cover the drain and it worked well enough after I wrapped a wash cloth around the base to help seal it off. I know these seem like small first world problems, but when you are staying at the Ritz there is a certain expectation of quality",

                "text": "The 1st night we checked in was the night the crazy storm hit DC. We ended up losing power that night (Fri) and it still hadn't returned as of Mon. While this was by not their fault, it made the stay quite dreadful. We had a busy day on Sat, as we were looking for houses (we're moving to DC) and didn't get back to the hotel until late the hotels with power were sold out. The room was disgusting, so we slept in the car and checked out on Sunday. Apparently, that was a mistake. The girl at the front desk said it shouldn't be a problem to get reimbursed for that night and the pre-paid nights we didn't stay. However, we were told to call the manager, who said that it is not customary for them to refund us for a night in which our things were in the hotel, even though it was miserable and we couldn't sleep there (I should mention that there was record-breaking heat). Ultimately, she refunded us for this night and we were satisfied. Had the power not been an issue, the hotel was pretty nice. The rooms seemed clean and were recently renovated. The staff was really nice too (even though they were hot tired). The location is pretty decent. They are currently working on the orange line though, so it's closed on the weekends at New Carrollton. Fortunately, the Greenbelt stop is about a 10 min drive away and there's free parking on the weekends. Ultimately, I think we just had bad luck and our stay would have been perfectly fine if the power hadn't gone out on day one.",

The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again.",

I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review.",

Not sure if this is part of their regular service, but we were sure happy with the arrangement! The beds were soft and super comfy, room was clean and relatively quiet from downtown noise, showers were hot with good pressure and breakfast the next day was decent.

I believe the hotel staff should of been montioring the 3rd floors better than they had. The air conditioner did not work at all in room 343 and it got really hot in there.I believe the bathrooms could of been a little more cleaner than what they were. I had asked for a rollaway bed and didnt get one because they were all out. I asked for more pillows and blankets and all they gave me was two blankets.

I am from NJ and was in VA for the weekend. The front desk clerk asked me if I had anywhere else to go while they had the opportunity to finish cleaning the room. The check in time stated on my reservation was 3:00 p.m. Apparently, the hotel did not receive this message. Eventually, I was able to receive a room.

When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it.",

Secondly, the Ramada is advertised in the Arundel Mills area, plenty of restaurants to choose from. However, on your way from the airport to the hotel, you realize that you are as far removed from as possible from anything nearby. They offer transportation to the Mall ( approx 4mi track) for 10.00. Obviously not customer-friendly. They infer that the transportation is to be free. Also, upon arrival in your room you discover there is no clock radio of any kind, there is no booklet to explain the amenities of the hotel or nearby attractions. When asking the front desk if if the booklet might have been taken, they sheepishly responded Wedon't have anything like that. The continental breakfast was ok noting that rarely was anyone from the staff keeping the items replenished or the juice containers from being completely out. After a 20 min return the orange juice was still out at 7:45 AM. Because of the lack of additional restaurant convenience I did eat at the hotel. The food was decent, but nothing to rave on and the cost was a little above average. Service at the restaurant was fair not because the servers weren't trying, tbut because there are only two servers period and one helps at the bar. Finally, there are no internet instructions posted in the room.",

The next morning, I discovered a dead cockroach. I don't know if that was a fluke, but that kind of shocked me a bit. I don't think bugs in general are very good. The area was quiet which was important to get some good sleep. The free breakfast was really good, the staff was super friendly, and the shuttle got me to the BWI airport fast. Overall, I think it's a good place, but needs a few things fixed. I recommend on the contingency those issues are fixed.",

There weren't any restaurants or fast food within walking distance of the hotel and we were hungry after traveling all day, but they did give us some bagels and cream cheese because they felt bad.

The door to the balcony was hard to lock unlock for the same reason, the AC was very loud, but it did keep us nice cool. The pillows on the bed were strange, instead of your normal sized pillows they were all about the size of a couch throw pillow (about 4-5 on a bed) they were very thick roundish. Too hard on the neck! The location was terrific though it was nice to have a free breakfast every morning. The breakfast bar included juices, tea, coffee milk. There was cereal, French toast, grits, sausage, eggs, pastries, fruit, yogurt, toast, English muffins, etc. You won't go away hungry:) The indoor pool was like a sauna. A bit too warm for us. The outdoor pool is very nice just across the room. There is parking right in front of the hotel or across the street in back of the outdoor pool. It is in walking distance of shops restaurants. It's also about an hour away from Busch Gardens. There is a great ice cream place right across from the hotel called 'Sweet Frog'. Awesome, but a bit on the expensive side. A great treat though.

Was told I had to wait to get new clean bathroom towels and pillow cases because they were in the washer. This was at 5pm in the afternoon. Thankfully, Alex who works at the front desk was very nice and brought up new towels and pillow cases. He was also very apologetic. Friday my beds were not fixed and house keeping just dropped the towels off without doing anything in the hotel room.",

I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus.

Room was very clean and the ammenities were plenty. Only thing is that rooms have LCD's but no HDTV cable, so quality of image was not what it's supposed to be. Check-in/out was very prompt and efficient. Will definitely stay at this hotel again if in DC area.",

The hotel is definitely too far to walk and neighborhood between metro and hotel is a bit sketchy with the apartments but the hotel is in a descant and quiet area. The check in staff did not seem too friendly nor helpful when asked about surrounding area. Once we got to know Sam, everything became better. He made sure we got got to metro station which is very convenient on time and inquired when we would return. He was there waiting!!!! Hotel is doing some remodeling but does not effect your stay.

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area.",

My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel.",

Depending on the day/time its about 30-45 min to downtown DC by car. They also offer shuttle service to nearest train station till 10pm everyday.

It's situated in Arlington a quieter,more idealic area than Washington dc itself although still very easy to visit all the attractions in DC via a short walk to Rosslyn, it's nearest metro.Hotel room was amazing value for money,very clean with a separate kitchen area.There is no hotel restaurant available and thekitchen was more than adequate to cook decent meals in. Our only complaint is that our gas cooker did not work and after mentioning it to the hotel it was never sorted out so we spent 2 weeks without a working cooker.As there is not much in the surrounding area we found ourselves having to travel into rosslyn and Washington to buy dinner.",

Not a good experience. The room and corridor had cigarette smell, even though we selected Smoke Free room. The blank has a big cut on it. House cleaning lady sometimes left a piece of paper on the floor even though we left 2 dollars as tip. Guess she might not be satified with us. Overall, the place is not a bad selection.

It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen. The only thing I was suprised at was the fact that we had to lift our heavy luggage up about 5 steps to get to the elevators. There were no ramps. From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot. Going up all those stairs with luggage did not look fun!",

I stayed in a studio suite and there was a full kitchen with dishes and cooking utensils and it was very clean. There was a flat screen tv and couch. (A bit uncomfortable though). The bed was comfortable with high quality sheets. The bathroom was clean, but a bit small. There is a lot of storage and a large closet, so it would be a good place to stay for an extended period of time. The staff was very attentive, and the Washington Post was delivered in the morning. The only complaints I have are that the internet password did not work (though I'm sure this could have been fixed had I bothered to call the front desk), the small bathroom, and the fact that you have to pay for parking (7 a night).

We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well.

A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC.",

They lack procedure, training and capability. Simple tasks were challenging. Don't count on getting a cab through the front desk unless you have 30-60 minutes to wait for one. Call the cab company yourself and make certain they have your name so some other frustrated customer doesn't take your cab. Good - they run a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro. Bad - there is no schedule and you have to look carefully for when they don't run, when they are doing a grocery store run, or when they are running to another facility they service. The Metro is across the street and down half a block from where they drop you off and pick you up. Since you don't know the schedule, you're standing on the street waiting. Dress appropriately and take an umbrella. There is no restaurant in the building. But there is a call in service which delivers food from many restaurants. I recommend this hotel IF you have your own car, are flexible about the age of the building, and don't rely on any services from the front desk.",

Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen.",

Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.

We got some really wonderful pictures; my favorite was when the kids were reaching for the chandelier and it looked like they were reaching for falling stars. The staff helped us stage some really cool shots, and were just fantastic. The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of mirror space and plug ins for curling irons; the window added lots of good, natural light. Lots of closet space let the kids get ready for after prom without too much problem.The only negative I have is that the hotel shuttle was not available, although when I called earlier in the week to make sure it was, I was assured that it would be available and that I didn't need a reservation.

However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager.

The ac unit under the window had to be turned down to 64, it kept going on and off at a higher level and it got stuffy. Would have been nicer if the fan kept running all the time instead of turning on and off with conditioning.

First, it was LOUD, which was very annoying at night. Secondly, we had a double room, and the bed closest to the unit is very close and is directly in the path of the cold air. I slept on this bed the first night and froze, I slept here on the second night and woke up with a terrible sore throat, which really sucked all the next day in the park. Other than that, everything else was fine. The hotel is clean, the heated pool and hot tub was great at the end of each day when you're really sore from all the walking in the park.

The rooms were very much to our liking and one can tell they put forth a good deal of effort to keep them clean. Guests seem to be coming and going quite a bit throughout the night, probably to and from the hospital, and the noise from the corridors seems to carry pretty good. We needed to ask for hotel maintenance to unclog the shower drain, but they did so promptly and without issue. Overall, the stay was as pleasant as one could expect while having to conduct business at the hospital. The surrounding area seemed pretty safe during the daytime, but there seemed to be a good deal of panhandlers and homeless roaming the area at night and would not recommend walking after dark.",

I know all hotels overbook but surely it's common courtesy to let you know before you arrive after a 9 hour flight and a couple of more hours getting through immigration, picking up a car and driving there.",

The location was great, just off International Drive but close to restaurants, shops and Universal.The staff at this hotel were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were large with two queen size beds, a flat screen tv with several channels and a decent sized bathroom. The hotel was very clean. An added bonus was free wi-fi. There were free safety deposit boxes at reception if needed.The hotel had a small shop, fitness centre and laundry facilities. The pool was nice as was the little spa pool which was hot!!The complimentary breakfast was more than adequate with plenty of choice to suit all tastes. We stayed on the fifth floor and found this to be nice and quiet.I would definitely recommend this hotel for couples, families and for overnight stays for business. I would stay here again as this hotel offers very good value for money.Thank you for taking the time to write such a nice review. We are delighted that you enjoyed your visit and hope to see you again soon!",

We drove all night from Maryland and just decided to power through the trip instead of stay overnight in SC and do the 2nd half of the drive today. This made us arrive much earlier than we originally planned. We decided to show up here anyway in hopes we could check in semi early. We are all so tired. To my surprise when we got here at 9 am they had a room ready for us and we were able to get in and rest right away. Check I was so easy and quick. The rooms are clean and spacious for our needs at a decent rate..I am very pleased and will definitely be back again on future trips.I am glad we were able to accomadate an early check in for you.

I travel with my service dog and felt I was mistreated by the person working at the front desk. Rick P was very condescending and not at all welcoming. He basically called me a liar and asked inappropriate questions regarding my service dog. He was overall an arrogant person. I felt like I was a prisoner in this hotel for fear of being ridiculed by staff. Staff for the most part just wanted to get the job done and didn't have time for cordial interactions. Room was okay, nothing special about this hotel -- Overpriced for what it is. The first interaction I had was with Rick, so nothing that the hotel could offer could make that better. They should train their staff on how to act with people with disabilities. Since then, I've been to other hotels that have treated me and my dog 10 times better than this place. Won't stay at any of their branches again out of principle.I certainly appreciate you writing a survey regarding your stay with us. I was made aware of this situation and have since reviewed ADA policy in regards to service animals, with all my front desk staff. I'm sorry you felt uncomfortable while staying with us, that is certainly not our objective. We are a hotel that does not allow pets, but service animals are not considered Pets by the ADA. We like any other business, are required by law to allow all animals being identified as service animals entry into the building. I apologize if one of my staff members took the questions too far or simply didn't understand the policy. Feel free to contact me directly should you want to discuss this matter further. Thank you for staying with us!",

The Room- If its comfort you want, its comfort you get, the beds and pillows were off a very nice quality. The television worked fine, yes you do watch a little t.v on vacation. Lighting was good in the room. No safe that's a shame. Good shower pressure, but the hot water was not as hot., one mention of this to reception, it was taken care of. management does listen.!! Location is excellent, right around the corner, lots of eatery, TGIF restaurant is okay,, big selection. but the asian buffet is better, for 12 all you can eat. Check it was easy enough, alain was very nice, and helpful. The room had a musty smell,, we did not complain,,, opened the window,, within a day it was gone. Breakfast--- ahem,,,,, well,,,,,like in previous remarks from others,,, its definetly overcrowded,,,,,which is annoying,,,but this morning into day 3,, they opened up a meeting room,,, for a overflow,,,yeaaaa,, what they should do is build a makeshift extension close to the pool,,, for the overflow,,. The breakfast is poor,,, not enough variation, what would it hurt to make a few salads,,, it would go a long way,,,think healthy.So in the mean time,,, This is a good hotel.... good value for the money,,,nice staff,,, lino at breakfast is very helpful. Enjoy your vacation,,, the hotel is good for all,,,families, couples,,, worth the price!!!",

                "text": "The hotel is clean and the rooms are modern. Price is reasonable. Location is close to Universal but a very busy intersection. Lost a couple of stars due to the following:1) Shuttle is overbooked and was never available for us to use since it was always sold out. The booking system does not require you to identify yourself, I believe many people overbook. The shuttle serves at least 4 hotels so a 5 minute trip ends up being 30 minutes to the park and is part of the reason the shuttle was sold out.2) Breakfast was mediocre and very crowded. Same items every day with little or no variety. By the 4th day we went to IHOP. Very crowded at times.3) While hotel staff were helpful, the service staff for the shuttle tickets were not. Service was poor and they were mostly interested in selling or up-selling park tickets. Frustrating to wait in line every morning behind many people buying tickets only to find out that the shuttle was sold out for the day.4) This seems picky but wi-fi was slow and spotty. Non-secured wi-fi usually is.We've stayed in far worse but we'll try another hotel next time as there are a lot of good choices in the area.Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We are glad that you liked our rooms and location but we apologize that you had difficulty with the shuttle service. Unfortunately during peak seasons the shuttles fill up quickly. It is possible to book your shuttle the day before your departure for the parks which would help to guarantee a seat. The ticket desk you are referring to is operated by Universal as are the shuttles to Universal. There are several departures each morning, but we realize during this busy month the early departures sold out quickly. Another option is to ask the front desk to call a cab which is only 8.00 and will get you to the park quickly. Parking at Universal can be difficult during high season as well and will cost 17.00 so a cab is sometimes the best option. We hope that you will visit us again.",

I stayed for 13 nights and my husband was with me for 9 nights following his surgery. I had no car (My husband did all the driving) so was relieved that there is a free shuttle which runs between the hotel and the hospital and is available upon request. Wendy's was right next to the car park and there is a 7 Eleven petrol station on the corner so I was able to get everything I needed. Having the fridge in the room and micowave was also very useful. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff whether it was getting extra pillows or faxing my insurance documents to the UK. What I needed most was kindness and I certainly got that from everybody we had dealings with. The rooms are a good size and I had a sofa for my husband to sit on and a desk where I could work. The showers are really good and the bath was most useful for my husband. The large King beds are out of this world -the best beds ever! The breakfast is more than adequate and we appreciated coffee being available all the time. Whilst a number of people stay because of the close proximity of the hotel to the hospital this hotel is a happy safe place and we had lots of fun around the pool whilst my husband was recovering.Yes there are no doubt better hotels in Orlando but not at this price and I doubt whether the beds will be any more comfortable. If you want excellent value for money in a safe friendly environment then book this hotel.",

The fixtures are all rusted in the bathroom and you can't look too deep into the room. Also, the housekeeper knocked on my door three times between 9-10am to lean my room. Although I appreciate her diligence, I told her I would be leaving around 10:15.

We travel to Orlando twice a year on business and always stay in a different hotel because we hadn't yet found one that fit all our criteria - clean, convenient, comfortable, safe and affordable - until now. This hotel is located just north of downtown Orlando (thus pretty far from the attractions) across the street from Florida Hospital. They offer a shuttle to the hospital. Valencia checked us in, what a professional. She was kind, warm and efficient. Excellent. We got a first floor room as we requested and it was perfect. Very clean and smelled great. The room was large with a nice sized bathroom, king bed and a sofa. It had the largest mini refrigerator we have ever seen. The freezer space was huge! The microwave was powerful. Nice TV with tons of channels including HBO. The bed was comfortable with several pillows of varying softness/firmness. Lots of towels. We enjoyed the jacuzzi both nights of our stay, it was very clean and very hot. We didn't use the pool but it was sparkling clean. We had to leave each morning before the free breakfast so we didn't get to try it. There is a Wendy's adjacent to the parking lot and a Panera and a frozen yogurt shop right across the street. We have finally found our Orlando hotel!Thank you for taking the time to comment on our Comfort Suites with such positive feedback! I have shared your comments with my staff, and they join me in thanking you for your kind words. We take pride in our hotel and the services we provide and we are so glad you enjoyed your stay.We are looking forward to providing you the same pleasant accommodations and service the next time you are in town.",

                "text": "The nicely decorated lobby and friendly check-in staff gave me a positive first impression of this hotel. The building looked well taken care of. It offers interior hallways and an elevator, which we really appreciated. We felt safe at all times, both inside the building and in the parking lot.Our room was a suite with two beds. To me, its just one big room, but an arched ceiling and half-walls separated the bed area from the sitting area, thus making it a suite. The room smelled and looked clean and was in good repair. It included a refrigerator and microwave. The TV was large and worked fine. The wireless Internet was easy to connect to and was fairly fast. The window a/c unit maintained an even temperature, keeping the room comfortable throughout our stay.The bathroom was large and clean. The secure hand-rail in the shower/tub was very helpful. The towels could have been a bit bigger, but they werent super small, either. We had no trouble getting hot water for showers. The metal toilet paper holder, which held two rolls of paper, was tarnished and did not hold the paper properly on one side. The end of the holder stayed open, which meant that one roll of paper was in constant danger of falling off. When we forced the end of the holder shut, it locked the roll of paper in so tight that it was unusable. This holder really needs replacing. Other than this minor inconvenience, our room was in good shape.We did not hear any noise at all during the night. The beds were firm and comfortable, and each had 4 square pillows. In the morning, we found a complimentary Wall Street Journal under our door.Breakfast consisted of a fairly large assortment of average-quality food. There were apple juice, orange juice, coffee, ice water, and milk to drink. The food items consisted of yogurt, fresh apples and oranges, hard-boiled eggs, assorted cereals, oatmeal packets, biscuits, white gravy, round patties of scrambled eggs, two waffle makers, toast, bagels cream cheese, and doughnuts. I liked the fact that the cereals were all in individual packages. The apple juice was highly watered down, and the biscuits and gravy were not the greatest. The toaster was old and didn't work too well, but the attendant said they would probably get a new one soon. Speaking of the attendant, she was very friendly and constantly present, watching over the area and asking folks if they needed anything.There is a Wendys within easy walking distance, just across the parking lot. Across the street is Florida Hospital South, which offers a free shuttle service between the hotel and the hospital. If you are staying in the area to visit a hospital patient, call the hotel directly and request their special hospital rate.",

The hotel offer a complimentary breakfast with a wide choice of food to set you up for a busy day ahead.

A two minute walk to the hustle and bustle of international drive, with all it's attractions and the i-ride, but just far enough away for a peaceful nights sleep.All staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. A HUGE special thank-you to Jennifer on reception for going that extra mile when helping me organise my trip to Miami, and to Ravin and Alain for your help with my return flights.We hope to return next year and would recommend the hotel to anyone planning a holiday to Orlando.Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review.

Large rooms with all facilities, great arrangements for drop-off and pickup for major Parks. Staff was very cooperative and the Lady at the Souvenir shop arranged best of the Tickets and passes for us - it all turned out to be value for money.Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience.

We also noticed our hair dryer holder from the wall was coming off. Breakfast menu is ok. Hot food changes every other day: scrambled eggs gravy with biscuits, scrambled eggs sausages. Lots of variety but after our third day...nah. Walking distance to International Drive, close to lots of gift shops and restaurants. Pool wasn't as clean, workout room was small and all old equipments (really need to upgrade), has a little snack shop by lobby, elevators are slow old and shuttle bus was good.

We are very grateful for this and made it nicer for us since we were traveling with a 3 year old. Our room was clean, quiet, and spacious. The pool was pleasant and the Hot Tub was well HOT!! The bathroom was large, but the floor was slippery when wet. My only complaint is that air conditioning seemed slightly off and the room seemed damp from it.

                "text": "Stayed at Comfort Inn for 2 weeks. Clean hotel with helpful staff. Room cleaned every day, plenty towel changes. Breakfast is complimentary with a selection for all does get repetitive but all hot and clean. If you are wanting a full English then go for one on I-drive. (free breakfast saves you time and money to get to parks quicker)Many reviews say no-where to sit, however we always found space and we were a family party of 8. If it was very busy they opened the side room.Taxi's - order from reception only use trusted companies.Free Shuttle - Universal and Islands of adventure-Take earlier bus from Hotel 7.55am this will ensure you make the most of your day at Universal. We got on all major attractions early morning and this enabled us to relax, stroll around to take the rest in.Disney Shuttle - Only one bus going for 10.35am (Disney parks are the busiest) this bus is ok for Epcot, Animal kingdom and water parks and late starts for evening shows, however for early starts use public buses on I-drive. Bus 8 The Lynx (make sure paw print is on bus stop) will take you to sea harbour drive from here take The Lynx bus 50 to ticket transportation then free shuttle to any Disney park. Magical Kingdom is a definite early starter. Free shuttle from Disney x3 check times. We got the 11.45pm one from magical kingdom which was a very good service for watching the shows. *this is the last bus and is only on if magic k is open until 11pm.SeaWorld and Aquatic we used I-trolley 2 dollars pp and 1 dollar per child.To get the free shuttle to busch gardens book at reception and this goes from CSI experience 5 minute walk from hotel.Local eateries - Chilli's, Tilted kilt, TGI Fridays, Denny's, CiCi's pizza, Perkins, Dunkin donuts....... just to name a few!Outlets are on either end of I - Drive - the one near seaworld is furthest away at stop 38 red line north I-trolley and the one closest to hotel is the biggest and you can again get I-trolley to bus stop number 1 located on I-drive going south same side as CiCi's.(can also catch the lynx 8 drops you off at slightly different stops either end.Top tipsIf have children and using public transport eat before you leave parks n case traffic busy.We took Robinsons cordial squishes and kept filling up our sports bottles in parks as it is all fizzy drinks. Fizzy drinks hyper kids!!All prams are asked to be folded on ALL transport so go ready.Be at any free shuttle 10 - 15 mins before due as they leave promptly and rightly so.Take poncho's everywhere you go.Buy one refill cup and keep returning to refill at universal and water parks and busch gardens. (again only fizzy pop)",

We found the Comfort Inn Suites Universal at a very reasonable price and looked for reviews. As always, there were some good ones and some bad ones. We took the chance and we got the surprise of our life.As soon as we arrive, we knew we had made the right choice.Checking-in was like a breeze. We have heard that the higher floors were quieter and had a better view and even though we have already a room assigned, the reception person (Neil), gave us a room even closer to the corner.The room was not only attractive, but huge and very clean. 2 very were comfortable queen beds plus an area with a sofa-bed and a table.The location is great for the price. 1.5 km (1 mile) from the Convention Center, one block from International Drive, close to all kind of restaurants and stores.Breakfast (between 6.30 and 10 am) could be a little better. It's not bad, but every morning they have the same items.By far the highlight of this hotel is the staff. They'll go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your stay. Kudos to Neil, Fuse and Orlando in the reception desk (if you need information, talk to them) and to the cleaning ladies which were always smiling and doing an excellent job. One morning we even saw the Manager (Alberto) cleaning the floor at the entrance of the elevators after a careless guest coming from breakfast, spilled some liquid and didn't do anything about it.The only down side is that the hotel receives large groups or tourists, and if one of these groups is having breakfast, you may be for a long wait.Like most Comfort Inn in the world, the service is superb. If you forgot any toiletry, all you have to do is ask for it.By far, one of the best hotel in the area for the price.We are going back to Orlando very soon, and we'll go back to the Comfort Inn Suites Universal ...... for more friendly and excellent service.CONGRATULATIONS!Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review about your stay with us. It is so nice of you to recognize our wonderful staff. I will share your comments with all of them. We are looking forward to having you as our guest again in the near future.",

There is a trolly stop (1.50 per ride) right in the front to take you to Sea World and Universal. The hotel offers a 20 per person shuttle to Disney World. We drove because the parking is only 15. I dont think the shuttle is worth it at all. The price for the hotel was the best i found in the area. it is a great deal for the price, clean rooms, large beds, pool for the kids. Large selection breakfast served daily. we had a different main course all 3 nights (sausage eggs, bacon omelettes, biscuits and gravy) along with the standard cereals, breads and yogurt. they do have waffle machines, but you have to wait in line. we went in the summer so it was always packed, but it is a great family place and price for your Orlando visit",

Went to the room very spacious changed and went to dinner on advise from the front desk they gave me a great dinner spot. Came back and discovered a/c wasn't running cold called the front desk they said they were full and couldn't move me handled it well though and in the morning the GM already new I had a problem and offered to make it right it was nice to not have bring it up again. We asked for a late check out and the GM was very accommodating and made it happen even though they were sold out so thank you I know how difficult that can be! It was a great location and the breakfast was the best I have ever had even compared to the ones I pay for. Usually when I go to Orlando I stay at the Gaylord Palms for way to much but I like the service from now on I will be at the Comfort Suites They went above and beyond! Very Clean and great value pretty pool area Like I said I'll be back in two weeks to bring my kids during spring break and I'll be canceling my reservation at the Gaylord and staying there again and I recommend you do too!!!",

The rooms are very generous size, 2 double beds, lovely comfortable mattress pillows, all new, the maid service was good, clean towels daily and room cleaned well. We were on the 4th floor, one room looking over the front of hotel the other room facing the pool, the pool view room was a little noisy at night but not a big problem as once it closed all was quiet again.Breakfast was fine, cereals, fruit (oranges, bananas, apples), bread toasters, bagels, scrambled eggs daily, sausages every other day alternating with some sort of porridge with scone like cakes (Americans call them biscuits), packets of porridge to mix yourself, hard boiled cold eggs, cream cheese, jams, muffins cinnamon rolls, orange juice (usual watered down cheap stuff) apple juice water, was ok but the breakfast area was very crowded with tables so when you went to get food drink you always had to squeeze past other people, coffee available all day. The hotel was still undergoing some renovation work on 3rd floor, 4th floor completed amd 5th floor I think was finished, we had a full size fridge in our rooms which was an unexpected bonus, there was also hairdrier iron + ironing board I didnt use them!) Laundry room on ground floor, 1.50 to wash and same to dry, only 2 machines though, not a problem when we were there but it was fairly quiet. The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful, seemed a safe area although we were in a car so didnt walk in the area at all, TGI restaurant nearby Golden Corral, cheapish buffet restaurant. Was concerned as hotel had changed names 3 times since we booked and had gone down the ratings chart but would certainly go to this hotel again. Very handy for Universal, just a few minutes drive and away from I Drive.Thank you for your kind review. Sorry that you had trouble finding us, our entrance sign is now illuminated. Our renovations have been completed and we hope to welcome you back on your next trip to Orlando!",

On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation.

                "text": "On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur.

Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well.

On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY.

The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York.

                "text": "We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel.

                "text": "Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean",

                "text": "Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",

The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark.

We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay.

The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast.

                "text": "The good First let's talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many! The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay. We truly hope to regain your trust and wish you all the best for the holiday season. Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",

Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves.

Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team",

As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average.

At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping.

Busses are on all surrounding streets. You're surrounded by many different restaurants of all varieties of ethnic and American foods.The rooms are large and the beds are comfy. The room thermostats don't work well so good luck with controlling your room temperature.Ice machine is in the garage but easy to get to.The ConsElevators are slow.The rooms are extremely thin so, if you don't mind noise and traffics orchestras, then you're good. Don't book here if you want silence or scenic views.It's an area of vagrants, homeless, and transients that may make you wary of wanting to wander around in the evenings. It didn't bother me but I could see it for those who can't handle it.I can sleep through anything so, I was at home.The WIFI works and I've not had problems doing work. Hot water is great when taking a shower.If I had a choice to stay here again, I'm might, but make it the last resort.Walgreens is only a block up to get last minutes sundries. Several coffee shops are available, and there are close nearby markets to get beer or cigs.None of the vagrants ever bothered me and I did not feel unsafe like a few of the other reviews I've read prior to booking.I did feel that this hotel can be better if the owners took some money and time to repaint, upgrade the plug in outlets, and added some affordable bathroom upgrades. More importantly, you're in SF, let this place be where you sleep, and enjoy the wonderful city.:)",

Its an easy walk from the Bart Station but walk up Polk St!It is in a sketchy area of San Fran. Polk St during the day is fine and you should be ok using Van Ness at night (we were on several occasions). There is also a CVS and Walgreens up Van Ness for basics. No rooms on ground floor and the elevator is the only way up and only staff can buzz you in the door to use the elevator so you are completely safe.Rooms basic. Very basic but clean although a refurbishment would be good. Theres an Ice machine and esky/cooler that you can use free of charge to take to your room. Wifi worked ok. Limited airflow in rooms since no air con or fan. Had to ask front desk for a fan and they seemed a little offended to be honest.You will hear all kinds of stuff at night from further down in the Tenderloin but you will sleep fine. For the price it is kind of a rough deal compared to basically anywhere else in the world, hence the rating. But for San Francisco at a budget rate, its ok for afew nights.",

We were very close to the interstate but the location was very quiet. Shopping centers, movie theater, and numerous restaraunts nearby. We had issues checking in and the room type we booked was not available the first night. We were put in a smaller room but we did get a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Breakfast included hot items but they left a bit to be desired but my kids loved the make your own waffles (get there early or prepare to stand in line for quite a while). The outdoor heated pool/hot tub area was nice and well stocked with towels. The rooms were a bit tight (family suites) but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. There are lots of families that stay here so there was constant noise from children running the corridors so if you are looking for peace and quiet this might not be for you. Overall a nice stay despite a few issues.We are glad that you liked the location of the hotel which is very close to all the attractions, walking distance shopping mall and restaurants. Thank you very much for appreciating heated pool. We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team.

What they didn't say, was that the staff themselves drank most of the free booze, and were hungover most of their shifts. The were more interested in sharing their drunken antics rather than providing any help to the customers. There was only one girl Billy who spoke English (and she's the least useful one out of them all), the rest of the staff spoke very little English and had trouble understanding us.The free alcohol turned lots of the hostel guests into violent drunks, who threw knives at each other in the kitchen whilst cooking.Hostel was extremely noisy and was impossible to sleep without earplugs. The mattress was creaky and filthy, and we didn't even dare to cover ourselves with their blankets, on which we had presumed was dried blood.",

It is approximately 30 min fast walk to Fishermans wharf or 10 min tram ride. The location is outstanding and I suppose you get what you pay for in that aspect. Wouls stay there again for a 1-2 night basis but any longer would not be ideal.",

                "text": "My partner booked us a twin bed room thinking it was the San Francisco Hostel International. What a mistake! We were given an incredibly squeaky (aka you can't roll over without waking up the whole floor including yourself) single bunk bed with stained mattresses. There was also some kind of unidentified matter smeared across the wall which could have easily been cleaned if they could be bothered. The bathrooms, halls etc we're all equally filthy.We asked to be changed into a twin bed room (as we had booked) or a double and we're constantly fobbed off by each staff member. Each would tell us to come back and speak to them again in x hours (when their shift had finished). When we went back they would be gone and it would start again. This also included the manager. I understand this place is closing in a few months (my guess is due to being shut down by health and safety) and as a result the staff do not care in the least. If you have another option then take it. And before you think this person sounds like a prude or is being precious I have stayed in probably 100 hostels allover the world and this is by far the worst. It also really affected our holiday in San Fran as there was no chance of sleep in the squeaky bunk bed. I note there are some decent reviews however most of them seem to be for the other hostel we tried to book (there ain't no waffles here!).You've been warned!!!",

Dont spend your money here. The people running this place would NEVER pass a health inspection..absolutley never. And i will be complaining. Because since I have been back I have had rashes all over my body. I just cant believe that people can get away with a place like this.try other hostels, we saw other nice ones whilst there. The bathrooms have full hairs in sink, and half eaten food everywhere..it was just a nightmare. ANY place should at least have clean sheets and not sheets filled with stains, and all different old sheets that had never been washed. A complete disguiting example of a hostel. Apalled. Oh and if you see good reviews..TRUST me its because the writers are proably backpackers (that are prob 16 and have never left home) and were absiolutley drunk and looking to party and they stayed here because they got free beer. BIG excitement..beer is like 5 bucks..go buy some and stay somwhere descent. Thats all",

We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism.

Not having to leave for dinner or breakfast was a huge plus. All the guests we met while there had smiles on their faces, I'm sure it was because of the great atmosphere Drury staff created.",

The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp.",

I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!",

When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions. Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly. In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step-by-step how to get to the international terminal. Great staff!Breakfast: awesome! Sausage and eggs were delicious. They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little. Also, it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale. I would definitely stay here again! Con",

Hot breakfast and dinner every day....dinner consisted of baked potato, cheddar cheese sause, hot dogs, salad and carrots, celery sticks every night. In addition, each night, there was at least one or more additional items - nachos/chicken tenders/etc. We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice. Staff was EXCELLENT. Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly. Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour.Only negativesThe pool was ok...a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor/outdoor feature was nice. On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience. Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay...room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked.",

They let us check in our bags early, the maid service was great (we tip them, you should too!) the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags (tip him too!)However, the heated indoor pool was not on. This is my main reason for choosing Drury, since I have children who love to swim. We were disappointed. The food, another reason we choose Drury, was not edible. There was popcorn made once a day, around 10 am, and there it sat all day. I will stay at Drury again, but not this one!",

The extra room, however, was very small (just enough room to unfold the bed) and couldn't be used for much more than sleeping (it had no TV). Strangely, the extra room also lacked any heat (it only had a cooling unit). We were in Anaheim during a cold spell in January so this was problematic but didn't ruin our stay.The standard room seemed a bit more updated than the suite but, aside from some peeling paint, both rooms were clean and comfortable. The hot breakfast was perfect (selection included belgian waffles, eggs, sausages, toast, pastries, cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit) but, as has been noted by other reviews, the seating area is woefully inadequate. Fortuntately, we weren't there during a busy time so the lack of room was more of a nuisance than anything else.I estimated the walk to Disneyland front gates to be about a mile. For us, it took 15 to 20 minutes, which was what we expected.Service was friendly and attentive. All in, given the price, we thought the value was excellent and would stay here again.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay with us. I am checking into the issue you had with no heat in the suites extra room. I am also having the bathrooms repainted as we speak. I will speak to our staff again about reporting any issues about the rooms to me. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I assure you that they will be fixed by your next visit.",

                "text": "We had 4 adults and 1 child (age 7). This was our grandchild's first trip away from home. Room 120 is marketed as a suite. It's not. It's a regular hotel room with 2 queen size beds and then a closet with a full size bed inside of it. I kid you not!The grandparents (us) wanted a seperate bedroom so we were stuck in the closet. There was not enough room for 2 adults to walk around in the room. You open the door and there's the bed. There was 6 from the edge of the opened door to the edge of the bed. The bed was up against the wall. There was one tv in the entire suite. That tv was outside of the closet bedroom. There was one side table lamp in the suite and that was not in the closet bedroom. The closet bedroom had a floor lamp on the opposite side of the closet from the bed and a blaring overhead light. There was just enough room in the closet bedroom to open one piece of luggage. There was a very small side table in the closet bedroom where one could put their clothes in...a bit tough if there's 2 adults in the closet bedroom staying 4 nights. What little carpet you were exposed to in the closet bedroom was sticky as though someone had spilled a soft drink by the side table.Had we known this we never would've booked here. Thus the reason for me writing to help other guests.The staff was extremely nice. We had rented a scooter and that was left in the hotel lobby overnight as none of the hotel rooms on the property would be able to accomodate a scooter. We were provided with plenty of clean towels in the one small bathroom in our suite.The pool was very clean.The breakfast consisted of frozen donuts (no microwave is available in the lobby eating area...if you wanted them heated up you had to take it to your room and use your microwave there), powdered scrambled eggs, bagels, small yogurts, a few pieces of fruit, milk, juice and coffee. Cereals were available from the bulk cereal dispenser and there was a waffle maker. The breakfast area was tiny. Since we stayed here from Oct 23 - Oct 27 there weren't a bunch of families to battle with in this breakfast area. I can not even fathom eating in the breakfast area during summer vacation, spring break, or during the holiday season when multiple families are in abundance. The seating consisted of 4 tables...2 tables accomodated 4 people and 2 tables accomodated 2 people (12 people total in the seating area). Of note, since this was something we had never experienced in any other hotels we've stayed in over a 40+ year span, there were two police vehicles parked outside the lobby with officers in the lobby that started one of our mornings off before heading to the Happiest Place on Earth. We didn't want to know what may have happened for their being there but the officers weren't there to partake in the breakfast, if you catch my drift.Parking was adequate and free. The maids like to trash talk about the guests in Spanish. This might be ok for persons who aren't Spanish-fluent, but we are. There's a sand pit playground area in the courtyard. It seemed to be in good repair. Our grandson didn't play in the area. I can't speak for any noise level this may cause in the rooms that surround the courtyard.Don't say you weren't warned. You get what you pay for. And no, we would never stay here again.",

A Walmart Neighborhood Market (grocery store for those of you who don't know) was about 10min down the road, too. The front desk staff was pleasant and check-in was easy. The 25 deposit was credited to my account immediately after checkout, too. Our room was clean and up-to-date. The towels were nice. Water pressure in the shower was also great. The mini fridge was really cold and the microwave was functional. My kids did take time to enjoy the pool, and they really liked it. It was clean and just the right temperature. Overall it was a great stay. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you for providing us with feedback regarding your most recent stay with us.

Loud road noise and an early siren kept my dreams away. Great and comfortable bed, nice desk chair, and timely room clean rounded out a pleasant stay. Getting to the hotel is not difficult, but if you stray from the delineated path you will enjoy some very wonderful neighborhoods, cozy streets, nice lakes, and a great downtown. Everyone was friendl and inviting, and the hotel staff was kind. The lobby has the necessities, a nice work area and seating. But it too is as loud as the city. A Wednesday evening brought a loud clamor, revelers and drinkers down to the happening bar. If you want to get some work done stay in the room, but if you are interested in meeting some friendly merry men, just sit in the lobby. Nice atmosphere inside and out, and I felt safe on the property. Ample parking and very easy access to Interestate 4 west or east. Downtown is a five minute drive west and is pleasant. Free wifi was more than adequate. Starbucks in the lobby at 6 a.m. and some relatively light breakfast foods are avaialable. Corporate rate was a pleasant 125, but a vendor I was with paid north of 200, which I think would be excessive. Overall a good experience, except for the noise.Thank you for sharing your experience on Trip Advisor. We are you pleased that you thoroughly enjoyed our facilities and exceeded your expectations. We are aware of the noise disturbance. Our hotel and other local business are working digiently to create a better experience for everyone without any disturbances.As a sign of our commitment and apology to you, we would like to offer you to have you back at our hotel when you're in Orlando again. Please feel free to contact me when you're planning your next trip. Thank you for thinking Courtyard Orlando Downtown!",

From what I have read, I am very excited about this stay and looking forward to meeting this amazing staff that is spoken so highly of. Most notably I will be asking for Maria Walker to make the most of my dining experience, as she appears to be an often mentioned rock star in many of the reviews I have read. This could be the stay that changes my mind and expands my accommodations world. Paying for a parking lot (and not a covered garage) seems a bit excessive and I would like to see a happy hour as many other hotels have come to in this price range.

Our 6th floor room was quiet and comfortable. The balcony was large enough for 4 people to sit and talk.Not a single complaint. It rained the day we were up and we got soaked. Since we did not pack extra stuff, we needed to do laundry. Soap and the machine use were complimentary. Wi-Fi was easy to setup. Fridge in the room, and bistro available downstairs.All in all, we will be back. This is our go-to hotel when visiting our kids in downtown Orlando.",

The rooms were spacious and well appointed. The ice machine (which worked) was near my room (SCORE)!!! Later that evening, we needed a drink and a snack and we did not have to go far. The Florida State game was on and we joined the folks to cheer the Seminoles on to victory. Fun was had by all in the comfortable seating available. The downtown location is easy to get to and easy access to I-4 the following day. Al in all, nice central location away from Disney. Although a bit pricey, will definitely consider returning when scheduling the next trip.",

It's hard to say what needs to be done - it was fine for us people who still remember 60s but our children were a little bit disappointed that kitchen and other amenities were not updated. Rooms were clean, cleaning service was friendly and responsive however everything looked rugged, old and lacked any charm. Too bad because the place is located in beautiful part of Carmel Valley. On the other hand if it exists for 60 years people must find it attractive and I wish the owner(s) good luck with this place for the next 60 years.",

The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house. But believe me next time will stay somewhere esle. I might have to drive further but maybe I will have a better stay!",

The hotel and room is renovated and modern but we were assigned to an accessible room on first night which layout made us feel uncomfortable. They changed to a standard room for us next day but that room was not cleaned yet after we came back from the beach at 8pm and they wanted us to wait 30 minutes for the room to be cleaned because they did not have other room available. The guy (I forgot his name but he made me feel like lacks of experience) at front desk kept justifying it is their system issue (which means ok for customer). Even after room cleaned, we found hair on the bed and pillow smells and they only put 1 glass in our room. I choose Hyatt Centric because of their location, modern design and the quality of Hyatt (used to be), but this experience made me disappointed. Their staff definitely needs more training.Hi Brian C,Thank you for sharing your review of your stay with us in Waikiki. We apologize for the inconvenience with your room assignment. We are in one of our busiest seasons and the hotel can regularly be at capacity.

Early check in was permitted and much appreciated after overnight flight, the front desk/ check in staff were fabulous with a friendly and informative attitude. We stayed in a corner suite room that was spacious and well appointed with a separate living area and large bedroom that also had a really nice bathroom with shower and bath. It was a lower floor overlooking the pool area-the pool itself was a shallow toddler type design with a slightly deeper jacuzzi attached. It was still popular with sunbathers but unfortunately you can't actually swim. The hotel had live loud music the night we stayed and was clearly audible until around 1030 at night. Higher floors or a room on opposite side of pool would avoid this. Overall a great stay here and even though it didn't have a balcony I'd definitely stay here again. The bed was super comfortable so a great night's sleep was achieved. Hi Nathan T,Thank you for sharing your review of your experience with us at Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach.

She was skeptical and not at all empathetic. She said they have a system that doesn't make mistakes. She is wrong. Dead wrong. Couldn't argue. Ran to car, sped to airport, missed plane.

The adorable courtyard with a pool is reason enough to stay. I could have spent all afternoon enjoying it. They had a continental breakfast which we did not take advantage of, but it looked like a pretty average continental breakfast spread. In the afternoon they put out cookies and lemonade in the eating area, I thought that was a really nice touch. We had one of the interior rooms, which I enjoyed, especially after a long night out in the Quarter, it allowed me to sleep much later than I would have if the sun had been shining in. I thought it was a very nicely appointed room, and very clean. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but everyone seemed friendly enough. I would definitely recommend Bienville House to anyone looking for a hotel in the French Quarter.Thank you so much for all of your positive feedback! We are so glad you had such a great stay and we hope to see you again soon for another awesome trip to New Orleans.",

But you're still two short blocks from Union Square. Reasonably small hotel the staff are courteous and helpful. We had dinner Friday night in the hotel bar - The Library. There was live jazz on Friday night and we discovered that about 2/3 the people in the bar were locals - who are quite friendly. Even the singer came and said hi to us after she'd finished.Powell St streetcar is half a block from the hotel, though we walked to the Pier 1 area in about 15 minutes (great farmers' market on Saturday morning). The hotel is about 5 minutes' walk from the Powell St BART station. For a cheapskate like me, that's a great airport connection. Plus, taking BART rather than a taxi saves 10lb of carbon emissions per journey. Plus it saves 20, plus it saves 30 minutes during rush hour, ...Food options abound. Lots of Thai restaurants around the corner",

I am in love with this place. The location is wonderful, too, just a few blocks from Union Square and 15 minutes walk to the conference centre. I do have to say thank goodness for conference rates, because as lovely as the Rex is, I still can't imagine paying 360/night for a hotel (but I'm a poor grad student, so take that as you will).",

On the other hand hotels towards Tenderloin area would not be a good choice if you like to take a walk around.

It was quiet. Rooms along the front are not! Needing improvement - the bed - I think it's old mattress and was wrapped in a zipped synthetic bag to protect the mattress I guess. It made the bed hot and sweaty. The pillows were not down and too large to actually sleep on w/o hurting your neck. We asked for a lower profile pillow and they got us one. The A/C unit sticks out the window and is very noisy - so we ran it before we went to bed to cool the room down. There is a small empty refrigerator in the room which we always like, but didn't know it would be there. Bottle of water costs 7 - really",

The building is quite old and the elevator was extremely small, so for people with claustrophobia it will be very difficult. When we approached the room we smelled a very odd and a bit gross smell, almost like urine. We where told that we where going to get a more spacious and bigger room, but when we saw the room i did wonder what a normal room would look like, because it was not big. There was a lot of dust on the floor and it almost looked like it had not been cleaned properly! We found black hair in the shower and it did not look appealing to take a shower. The next day when we came back to the room later, the dust and the hair was gone... the air condition was very load and where put right next to the bed near the window, so the person lying there would have trouble sleeping at night. The hotel is very close to union square and it took only a couple of minutes to walk. The staff was helpful and nice, which we appreciated a lot! The library bar near the lobby was very cool and the music there was amazing!Hotel Rex was very expensive! But I guess that is the price in san franscico, especially for a hotel near the union square..Hello651, thank you so much for staying with us and kind words about our staff.

Do get a comfortable pair of sketchers (there is a shop near by buy one get second half price) as you will be walking up and down hills a lot! The air conditioning in our room 709 was a bit noisy so I was glad we did not need it much. You get a faint hum of the San Francisco sound at night which I loved and was not disturbing . We didn't dine in at all so can't comment on the food . So many eateries in San Fran. to choose from and loris for breakfast just down the hill a few yards on the same side has great choice and sensible price. We spent three nights here over a week end with another couple in the next room and we were able to shut the outer door and kept our own door open on occasions so great if you are with family or with close friends!Would certainly recommend staying here.",

We arrived after getting the Bart from the airport to union square then walking a couple of blocks to hotel at around 5.15 and was checked into our room straight away by very nice and helpful staff the porter guy took our bags for us and showed us to our room and mentioned the wine hour in the bat that goes on every night 5-6 pm which was great. The room was comfy and big enough for us with a good shower. Our view wasn't the best but it didn't really bother us a we were only using room to crash at night after adventuring around. Noise from outside was fine too. Could sleep perfectly well. The food in the restaurant looked good we had breakfast one morning which was tasty and priced well. Hotel is in a great location for shopping and sightseeing catching the trams to fisherman's wharf just perfect stay to our trip with everyone we can across to be friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back when in San Francisco again. JimmyD23,Wow - 3 weeks across California! Sounds like a great trip. Thank you for stopping by the Rex during this adventure. I'm glad to hear you took advantage of our complimentary wine hour - we think it's important make our guests feel at home. Until next time! Eric",

This is our first time at this particular hotel and staying with this chain. The positives are this hotel is nice, very updated, we found our 2 bedroom suite to be very spacious, very clean, and the offerings for the food choices of the happy hour and breakfast exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful. They even assisted me to book needed activities for our family. The negatives are this establishment is ran so tightly it is at the expense of the comfort of its customers. The happy hour requires you to keep up with a card per adult to ensure you receive no more than 3 beverages. The happy hour offerings are of course well drinks and cheap wine. My husband accidentally spilled his last glass of wine at the bar and the employee made mention he was exceeding the allowable amount of beverage as he begrudgingly replaced it. The air conditioner is fixed to not go below 70 F. Our entire family was extremely uncomfortable and sweated all night. The tubs are fixed to only allow showers. There are not individual toiletries. Instead there is a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser attached to the wall. It kind of grossed me out to think every other naked person before had touched it during their shower. They do advertise to earn so many reward points for everyday you do not utilize housekeeping so that leads me to believe this is a brand/chain initiative. It's a nice hotel that is uncomfortable and that's just unfortunate. My husband's review was, It's like being a guest of a cheapskate.",

I received a call from the hotel manager who called to let me know they would still hold our room for us. I thought that was very nice. We arrived at the hotel and I was skeptical when I saw the outside of the building. My boyfriend reassured me that inside was probably much nicer and most buildings in New Orleans look like that on the outside. I was amazed from the moment we stepped foot in the lobby!!! The staff were courteous and the room was more than clean. I always inspect the bed and the shower upon entering my room and I couldn't find ONE thing to complain about, which is very rare lol. We also went down to the 5:30 Kickback where the hotel provided free food and and drinks. Overall, our stay was well worth every penny spent!!

We remembered having a very nice stay there before so decided to try this hotel again. The location is wonderful...right next to the trolley line (but not a noice issue...very quite). The price is very reasonable. We checked around...an excellent value in my opinion. We got a 2 room King Suite for the 3 of us. We loved everything about this room. The ceilings and windows are old-style tall...which just feels right in this city. There is lots of granite everywhere. The living room is a completely separate room so everyone had their privacy. The king bed was very comfortable. My 17 year old son said the fold out couch was pretty nice too....although he wouldn't want to share it with anyone...then again, he's 6'4 and about 210 lbs.! The breakfast was a very nice buffet, hot, and plentiful with real scrambled eggs, biscuits, bacon, fruit, juice...and the evening cocktails/soda and wings, chips, baked potatoes, hotdogs, veggies, dips, chicken fingers were plentiful and a great alternative to eating out again. We had a big lunch so just snack food was perfect allowing us time to enjoy the pool on the ROOF!! Parking is fenced, selfpark right next to the hotel for about 17. It is within easy walking distance of the famous Mother's...and all the traditional New Orleans favorites. When you consider the price of breakfast and the free alcoholic beverages and snacks...it is so worth the price....I think with parking included we paid about 150 tops. I am ready to go there again!",

The new addition to this complex will certainly enhance the appeal once it opens later on this year.",

The room was clean and had a mini-refrigerator and flat screen television that also had digital channel selections. The bed was very comfortable. The curtains kept the light out when closed.They have an evening buffet, which was very good. You also get up to three individual selections of beer or mixed drinks. Breakfast was very good also and has wide selection. They also have popcorn and soft drink area that is open until around 10 pm daily.The hotel is about three blocks from the French Quarter which is easy to walk and convenient.

Check in was painless. I was able to check in early before noon. The breakfast is nice. They have more than the average hotel breakfast. Eggs, sausage, biscuits, Oatmeal, potatos, waffle makers along with the normal fruit, cold cereral, yogurt type items. The afternoon kick back food is nice. Hot dogs,, check tenders, etc. This hotel is perfect for a large family with lots of kids. You can save money with the free meals and drinks. The free drinks are nice, not a big selection alcohol wise. A few types of wine and beer, vodka, bloody marys, tonic water, orange juice is about the extent of the alcohol. Its free, so just go with the flow!! Popcorn and pop in the afternoon also. Our room was on the 8th floor facing Carondelet street and had a nice view. Not much street noise. Room had double beds and was nice. High ceilings and large windows. Comfy beds. No exhaust in the bathroom. Housekeeping met expectations. The hotel is on Poydras which is in the business district so you will have to walk to get to the action of Canal street and the French Quarter. French quarter was about 5 or 6 blocks straight up Carondelet. We walked it LATE at night/EARLY morning and had no problem. Didn't feel unsafe. Trolley car line is at the corner. Stadium is about 5 or 6 blocks up the street. They have 2 computers in the lobby with printers. I had no problems with them. Also an ATM. 3 ATM charge. Nice sitting area to relax in the lobby and downstairs. The location isn't THAT bad. If you want to see a lot, then there will be a lot of walking or trolley riding. Cabs are plentiful and the front desk will call you a cab which I recommend. Unless you are VERY picky, high class type and expect EVERY little thing to be perfect, just about anyone should like this hotel and be satisfied. Its not 5 star Sheraton fancy, but not a Motel 6.",

And at 5:30pm it looked like guests actually dine on the wings, baked potatoes, hot dogs and the chili provided in lieu of heading out to dinner. Rouses, an attractive grocery, is nearby for quick fill-ins or paninis made to order or practically anything else food-related. The bed, in my opinion, was a bit soft as were the pillows. I wish they had queen-size beds too. The staff is very accommodating and willing to make suggestions for clubs, restaurants or attractions. The Drury is clean and modern and is currently building an addition which should provide more variety of rooms and maybe even a fancier breakfast.

Another of the reasons that we chose this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor was that the hotel is close enough to walk to the French Quarter and Canal Street, but far enough from the noise of Bourbon Street that you could actually get a good night's sleep. We were able to walk to the French Quarter for sightseeing and to the restaurants.

The staff was very nice and helpful. We left our room early in the morning and several days near noon and upon our return our room was nice and tidy. We had a jacuzzi suite and it was quite spacious...enough room for much more than two people. There are two full size closets, mini fridge, flat panel TV, livingroom, and separate bedroom. The short walk to the French Quarter was nice and there is a Domino's just around the corner for an evening snack...or there are many nicer places that deliver to the hotel. Maybe the only little thing that kind of bothered us was the view. I am not sure if all jacuzzie suites are situated in the back corner of the hotel but our view was faced west and consisted primarily of two brick walls bordering the parking lot and some buildings off in the distance. Since we didn't spend much time in our room, the view did not bother us much. It was our first trip to New Orleans for some of the Mardi Gras festivities and we look forward to staying here again in the future.",

                "text": "I recently stayed at the Drury Inn for 3 nights. I was assigned a corner room on the 6th fl that had two exposures of Poydras street. I was very satisfied with the room. It was quiet (some minor street noise), very well appointed, had a nice whirlpool type jet tub, and the TV channel selection was decent. The room was clean and well cared for. The hotel was very nice, had some character, and was close to most of what people want to see when visiting New Orleans. However, it was a few blocks from most of those attractions, which I didnt mind, but someone who wants to be in the thick of the action might find it disappointing being in the business district where the hotel is. The walk to the waterfront or Bourbon Street was about 6 blocks and felt safe even at night. The free food and drink was a big plus. The breakfast offerings met all my expectations. Well-cooked scrambled eggs, waffles, bagels, etc. The afternoon happy hour selection was weaker. The hot dogs were consistently under cooked and somewhat unattractive in appearance. I would say beef was either non-existent or way down on the ingredients listing. The other foods were satisfactory, but nothing off the charts. Hey, but this was all free, so I cant subtract points. But if you plan on feasting your physician will take exception with your meal choices. In a general sense, based on observations at various times during my midweek visit, this hotel tends to attract a somewhat older crowd.say vacationing retirees. I only saw 1 child during my 3 day visit and limited people in their 40s or less. My only real issue with the hotel was the fitness center. It literally consisted of 2 treadmills and a bike. Nothing else. If a hotel advertises offering such an amenity, I dont think such a limited offering qualifies. While there was a sign up suggesting an improved offering will be forthcoming when the new hotel wing is complete, that didnt help me on my visit and I only consider hotels that offer such because I plan on using them. I wasnt able to here.All in all, I was satisfied with my stay despite the fitness center misrepresentation. I would not hesitate to select the Drury on a future stay.",

You are only four blocks from Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street or the streetcar stops right outside the hotel if you don't feel like walking. 3 for a 24 hour pass is a good deal and an easy way to move around all the key tourist areas. The Drury Inn offers excellent accommodation for the money: we had an oversized 2 room suite King Bed Non-Smoking suite for five nights which was clean, comfortable, well laid out. The Breakfast and Kick Back offerings should be seen as a bonus: it's quite naturally geared to US tastes and if you like what's on offer then enjoy (we did for the most part) if not then there are plenty of good eating spots within easy reach. As for the three alcoholic drinks each night what's to complain about Just be aware there are quite long lines on Friday and Saturday nights. Finally, many thanks to Kyle, Assistant General Manager, for the useful chats we had about New Orleans/ Memphis and Daniel always helpful and courteous in the dining room.",

Desperate to find accommodations my husband walked into the Drury Inn on Poydras St. and booked the last room of the hotel.The lobby was lively with happy hour and we enjoyed a quick glass of wine before going to our room on the first floor! We were amazed at the quality and comfort considering the low price we were offered! ( Ask for those military and senior discounts.) The staff was courteous and friendly, the room quiet and comfortable! The inn is close to the quarter and cost a mere 6 for a friendly cab ride! We were dropped off right at the start of the parade on Bourbon St and enjoyed a after-parade drink in another hotel on Canal. We were fortunate to meet the Grand Marshall's family and enjoy their story of life in and around New Orleans! Parking is extra but well worth the price and peace of mind knowing your car is being cared for in an off-site location.",

We were looking for a nice place that was near major tourist attractions and didn't cost a lot - as we were just passing through on the way to our vacation. This Drury worked out nicely.It was easy to find from I-10 - near the SuperDome and close enough to French Quarter that we could walk - even in the heat of July. Having said that, I did have the impression that it was closer. We walked to Canal St and the Riverwalk - several blocks and then worked our way back through a couple of FQ streets to find a spot for dinner. It was a LOT of walking. After dinner, we caught a cab (for less than 10) back to the hotel. We spent the evening in the rooftop pool. It was fairly small, but adequate. Our room had beautiful tall windows and ceilings, making quite a first impression. The beds were comfortable. The parking lot side of the building was rather loud because of the frequent passing by of the streetcar (this streetcar went to the Garden District, I think). Parking was 15 - a bargain compared to most of the hotels I looked at, and it was self park. You needed your room key to get in/out of the lot, but could come and go as you please. Much easier than valet, in my opinion.Breakfast was nothing special. We found the area crowded and the selection very limited. We ate a small bite and stopped at Cafe du Monde for beignets later in the morning. We would stay here again under the same circumstances, but if you are planning a longer stay or want a hotel with more of a NO feel, Le Pavillion is right across the street and is beautiful. Hotel Monteleone was a little closer to things and was the most beautiful hotel I saw. We paid an internet price of approx 80 (+tax) and 15 for parking.",

The free breakfast, popcorn and drinks, and kick back made our trip even more economical. Free shuttle to the Mardi Gras museum from the hotel. Great outdoor pool the girls loved to splash around in after a long day of sight seeing. The elevators require roomkeys to access, which is an added security feature we appreciated. Excellent location from which to explore the French Quarter, catch a tram, and head out and about. Also, walking distance from the Amtrak station.",

                "text": "Cannot say enough good about this hotel. Sometimes I pick obscure places to stay on vacation...but our 2 teens have declared that I have redeemed myself with this hotel pick! Everything here is new, fresh, modern, and clean. Huge rooms. Huge living area with sofa bed, desk, chairs, TV huge bedroom with 2 queens, TV, bench huge bathroom, etc. The absolute best part is the breakfast and dinner/cocktail hour. Breakfast is a real buffet with sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuits, waffles, pastries, etc. Even more surprising, the cocktail/snack hour really is a light dinner buffet. They have a salad bar, baked potato bar, a pasta dish, chicken strips, hot dogs, soup, nachos, chips/salsa, etc. We decided to just make a meal of it the night we arrived. Great for kids. You are able to get 3 drinks/person each evening: 4 kinds of wine, Bud Light on tap, margaritas, and several cocktails/mixed drinks. They also have coffee and a soda fountain. The lobby has a refreshment station with popcorn, a soda fountain, and 24/7 coffee. The hotel is a couple block walk to the SuperDome, and a reasonable 10 minute (safe) walk down Poydros to the riverfront, including the big Hilton, Harrah's, and the outlet mall. From there, it's a few blocks East to Jackson Sqaure/Cafe du Monde, etc. The cross street here becomes Bourbon St. When it crosses Canal St. (The official divider between the French Quarter and the CBD), so you're really right in the heart of the action in a 10 min walk that direction also. Great location all around! They valet park everything, but have a massive motor court where they can pull around 15+ cars at a time, so no problem there. We will definitely choose this hotel for our next visit to the Big Easy!",

It is very accessible you can walk to and from French Quarter from day to night without any problem. You can also go to the Garden District by taking the Streetcar without any hassle. They also offer free breakfast, free dinner (and some cocktails) and free snacks which are a major plus. This helps a lot especially when you're on a budget.If you're driving to NOLA, this hotel offers valet parking for 25 + tax. The other hotels' parking costs around 35-40 so this one offers a pretty good value. It's actually difficult to find a parking space in French Quarter, so I advise for you guys to just walk. But, we did drive one time when we booked a swamp tour.We liked NOLA a lot and we're definitely coming back! Next time, we won't have to scout for hotels because we would rather stay at Drury Inn again!",

We did have a small complaint that our room smelled like smoke it didn't really bother us that much, but we didn't want to get charged for smoking in the room when we didn't, so we reported it. The guy at the front desk said he would have someone right up to deodorize it and credited us for our parking fee for the inconvenience. That was SO nice!

On Sun-Thur, each adult guest receives three complimentary evening cocktails in the lobby.The rooftop pool is small, as is the fitness center.The lobby is beautiful, with marble floors and nice chandeliers. We stayed in a king suite, and it had tons of space, although the bathroom area seemed small. Our teenaged nephew slept on the pull-out sofa, and appreciated all the room he had to spread out. He also appreciated that we had our own tv in the bedroom, so he could have control over the one in the living room. He loved the free internet access, but didn't love the TONS of pop-up ads that came along with it.The king suite had:One bedroom with king bed, two night stands with lamps, entertainment center with television, telephone, and closet. Living area with pull-out sofa, chair, recliner, coffee table, entertainment center with television, refrigerator, and microwave (2 free soft drinks and microwave popcorn provided), and desk area with internet access.The vanity area had another closet, as well as a coffee maker. Parking is 13 a day, which is a bargain. The lot is self-park, no valet, so you have access to your car whenever you need it.Make sure your room key is always handy. You need it to get in and out of the parking area, to use the elevators, and to get into the back entrance (all day) or the lobby entrance (after hours).This was our third trip to New Orleans, and our first stay at the Drury.

The free drink and snack time each evening was a nice perk, though we were only present for it once -- too many other things to do in the area!

Not to leave out Jonathan, Jeremy, and Brandon, our Valet's. These guys were very pleasant and gave off a great spirit while taking care of our vehicle making sure it was always ready to roll, often on short notice. I witnessed them actually running to provide positive service for us and other guests. All in all everyone we came in contact with were great representatives for this company. I will continue to seek out Drury for our travels. I'm Wardog and I approve this message.",

The lobby is very attractive and welcoming. The room was clean, comfortable and large with vaulted ceilings and very tastefully decorated. We enjoyed the happy hour with three free alcoholic drinks each and hot and cold snacks. Breakfast was also included - fairly typical choices of cereal, scrambled eggs etc.. The staff were very friendly. It's in a great location - the cable car stops out front and it's an easy 5 minute walk to Bourbon St. We will definitely stay here again.",

Hors d'oeuvres served in the evening along with 3 free alcoholic drinks per person. However, if you do this, you lose the chance to sample all the great New Orleans restaurants. g But, if you are on a tight budget, this really helps to defray expenses.Trolley line is just across the street from the front door and it will get you to just about everywhere in the area.King size bed was comfortable with 5 pillows provided. Our room had a whirlpool bath. Front desk clerks are so pleasant and always smiling considering they seem to spend most of their time answering tourist questions. My thanks to Renaldo, Ayila and Star. I will definitely stay at this hotel next time I return. And I had so much fun in this city, I expect to return soon.OldTOm",

Valet parking was very quick efficient, both coming going. The desk clerks were very friendly, efficient and accommodating. The room was sparkling clean and nicely appointed (I was in the older part but couldn't have asked for a better room). My room faced Poydras, so may have been a little better view than other parts of the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised that the bathroom/vanity area had very nice bright lighting and the water pressure and hot water were excellent. Nice extras - 3 complimentary alcoholic drinks and a nice assortment of foods during the 5:30-7pm evening cocktail/food period.. meatballs, ziti pasta, hot dogs, chips, cheese dip, salad bar, chicken fingers, baked potatoes, etc. in a nice large open area to dine, so even though there were many people taking advantage of this, it wasn't uncomfortably crowded and the food bars were well-attended. Though I did not get the opportunity to see much of the city, it was definitely within walking distance of the riverwalk area and the French Quarter. I definitely will stay here again.",

Although there are no restaurants in this hotel, they can get delivery of almost anything you can think of as far as food. The first night I was there, I was leary of walking to a nearby restaurant or Bourbon Street, but there was no need to be. This hotel is growing and has a brand new wing that will open in about 6-12 months. The construction commenced M-F starting at 7A, but no contruction on the weekends!

Check in was quick and the clerk was extremely friendly and helpful. I requested the highest floor and away from street traffic and both were granted. The hotel is really nice inside and was spotless. Our room was a double and it was extremely clean and roomy. The bathroom was really nice and the beds were comfortable. We had adequate towels for the two of us. Another plus for this hotel is the secured parking lot is adjacent to the building. I really don't think there was anything that I would say needed improvement there. Customer service was great throughout the stay. You have to use your roomkey to access the hotel after 10:00 PM. You also have to use the key to operate the elevators from the lobby and to open and close the gate so be sure to keep one of your room keys when you check out if you are driving or you will have to go back inside as I did to get a key to get your car out. The hotel is walking distance to Bourbon St and the Riverwalk area (In my opinion). It may be a little far if you have any mobility issues. It is only a 4 or 5 block walk to the Superdome or the New Orleans Arena. We will be staying here again in the future.",

Also, thank you for pointing out the items that were not working properly while you were here. As you experienced, we have no problem fixing things when we are made aware and making them right. One item that did not get fixed until you were gone was the sugar ants, but I want to let you know that too has been resolved the day you checked-out we had an exterminator come in and treat the room, and then revisit it a week later.I am sorry this was not a memorable trip for the right reasons, but I appreciate your kind words about the team.

The bathroom was a bit on the small side with a toilet and bath with shower over and a sink outside the bathroom. The bathroom again was very clean. The room was very quiet we never heard a noise all night.There was valet parking available for 30 per night.The complimentary breakfast was good, there was plenty of choice and it was well organised with a clean breakfast area and helpful staff.The night reception was excellent. There was unlimited soft drinks available, 3 alcoholic drinks per person and food. The food was best we have ever seen at an evening reception this included hot dogs, nachos, baked potatoes, salad, chilli.There was also popcorn available late afternoon into the night time available in the lobby area along with coffee and soft drinks. I think soft drinks were also available for a few hours inthe morning. The staff at the hotel reception were very friendly and helpful.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New Orleans and if we ever return I would stay here.

Service and customer focused staff in all areas of the hotel looked after customers with genuine care. Every evening from 5.30pm they have the Manager's reception, which entails a free drink of your choice and extensive snacks. both hot and cold food. The breakfast is very adequate (cereals. eggs. waffles, juices, toast etc) .. and there are number of dishes. Perhaps some cut up fruit would have been good but there was bananas and apples available. There is coffee, juice, soda. Iced water available any time of the day in the reception area.The pool on the rooftop is excellent with strangely enough few guests using it....which suited us very well. always sparkling clean and fresh towels available. The small gym got a little hot and stuffy after 8am as the sun streamed in through a number of windows. We walked an easy walk to the riverfront where you can catch the street car. There usually is a street car operating outside the hotel but maintenance work was in progress when we stayed and only buses were available. The hotel has just commenced the building of a new wing and originally was due for completion in June 2013 but now completion is expected December 2013. We stayed in room 821 and had a small balcony overlooking the early stages of the construction sight. Didn't experience any inconvenience or noise. In fact had a lovely view at night as there was nothing obstructing our view, but this will change as the new hotel wing progresses. You will be fine for several months until this occurs. There is a small fridge and microwave in the cupboard which is adequate but go down to Frenchmen's Street for some great cafes and restaurants. Go to Coups Place for great Cajun food and cheap too! There is no doorman opening and closing doors. but who cares with all the other advantages one has in staying in this delightful hotel. So nice to know that management staff care about you and your stay at their hotel! Would recommend this hotel without any concern. When you book in 2013 to stay just first ask about the construction progress so you can enjoy your stay free of any inconvenience.",

The last time they booked us for a suite the first night (because of lack of availability) and booked us the regular room the other nights. However, when we arrived, they let us have the suite for all 3 nights and did not charge additional (I might add that it was during the week). This way we didn't have to change rooms. Valet parking, although expensive, was great w/not too long of a wait. Free breakfast (multiple waffle makers, sausage, eggs, pastries, gravy, fruit etc.--not super high quality but better than a lot of hotels), snack type dinner (hotdogs, chicken strips, meatballs, etc..--again, not super high quality but plenty of food excellent offerings especially if you are on a budget), and free popcorn pops from 3-10pm. You could actually eat breakfast at the hotel, dinner at the hotel and then only pay for lunch if you wanted to. My absolutely only complaint about this hotel was that they offered 3 alcoholic drinks for each adult in the evening 5-7 during dinner (only 3 different drinks offered). We are not big drinkers but like to have one from time to time. We ordered one 2 different nights but were unable to drink them because they were so incredibly strong--we even asked to go light on the alcohol to no avail. We were also disappointed they didn't have a full bar where you could pay for a frozen drink if you wanted. Other than that small detail this hotel was really clean, nice clean pool w/plenty of clean towels, friendly staff, quiet and close enough to walk to shops and such. It seemed to be located between the Garden District the French Quarter. We definitely would return.",

There's also a complimentary happy hour with food, but we were out about. The rooms were nice - the beds suited us, there was a small refrig the shower was OK. An appreciated detail was that there are an abundant number of outlets throughout the room. If driving, it's not too far off the I-10 hotel parking is valet only.",

We went to New Orleans for Christmas just to visit and the staff were super friendly, the hotel was very clean, the room was spacious, the bed was super comfy (and for me to say that is amazing) and the Kick Back is a great deal as well. What more can you ask for than free drinks (3 per person per evening) and free food that could be your dinner if you aren't planning on visiting a restaurant. Everything about this stay was great. When I come back, and I will, I plan to stay with you guys again. I know the hotel industry is tough and no one likes working Christmas anyhow, but everyone had a smile on their faces the whole time.

The lobby displayed a classic 1920s hotel style, as well as a grand staircase. The hotel's elevators are room key activated only, for safety reasons. We had a smoking corner room on the ninth floor and there was no trace of smoke anywhere in the room. There was clean white sheets on the bed and clean carpets. Also to our surprise, there was a door that led out to a balcony (we was one of the two rooms to have this.), which I enjoyed being a outdoors person. The bathroom was clean and spotless. The shower provided shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, although I brought my own. The 5:30 Kickback in the lobby was like dinner to us. There was hot dogs, chicken tenders, cocktails, and liquor (2 for every person and show your room key). The pool and hot tub were clean and pristine, although I didn't use it. The views from the rooftop were breathtaking. The fitness room had a bike and step machines and two treadmills (a somewhat small room, though). The general manager and his staff were great to us. I will recommend this Drury Hotel and will stay here again when I come back to NOLA.",

The plus for us is, this hotel is located around 1 block of the parade route. Being at the end of the route also gives you the opportunity to score bags and bags stuff being slung off the floats. It's also so close that if you have to use the restroom, you have a clean private restroom right around the corner. If you don't mind the walk, this location is also only around half a mile from Burbon and French Quarter. There are other hotels near, but we enjoy this hotel enough that we would continue to lock down a room during this party.They also have a buffet breakfast, nothing fancy... eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, cereal, grits, biscuit and gravy.

We had a king room on the 7th floor- the view was of a parking lot with graffiti on the walls. The room was perfectly adequate though- the bed was comfy, shower pressure good, and we didn't hear any noise from outside or within the hotel. Nice and quiet- we slept great. The 5:30 kickback was great! Free drinks and appetizers. I just wish it lasted more than an hour since we didn't make it back to the hotel in time each night for it. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful as well. Waffle maker, hot buffet items, juices, etc. And included in the cost of the hotel room- a great plus. The hotel was a short walk from French quarter and other areas of interest. The city bus ran close by to the hotel- we took this to the City Park and rode bikes, as well as to the Jazz Fest. The price for our room was pretty steep since it was during Jazz Fest- but we still felt like it was a good value and in line with other hotels in the area. Parking was 25 a night plus tax. The hotel is still undergoing renovations- it looks like the parking garage will be attached to the building rather than 10 minutes away which will be nice. Overall would recommend staying here- no reservations!",

To make a long story short- Drury Inn charged me for two rooms but failed to let me know that upon arrival or checking in the hotel (I had apreviously called the hotel to cancel the reservation FYI). After I noticed the charge on my account I called and spoke with the manager Patrick to reverse the charges. He was super rude, loud talking over me, and had an I dont care attitude. He stated that he would fax in the necessary paperwork to my bank as they requested via email.( that was a Sunday) Monday went and still no funds-Tuesday came and still no funds. At this point my automatic withdrawals started to come out of the account. Which enabled my account to go in the negative and it set a domino effect. I checked in on Saturday and my bank froze my account due to suspicious fraud so I wasnt able to get any money off my account (but it didnt matter because Drury Inn had it all wrap up). Tuesday before I left I spoke with my bank and they told me they never received the proper paperwork so I went to the front desk and spoke with Jaime and she faxed the proper info over for me. Not even 30 minutes later my bank called me and said they received the paperwork and the funds are credited to my account. Now on to the housekeeping- our room had not been cleaned the entire time we were there- which was a Saturday through a Tuesday. Yes the trash was emptied and the beds covers had been pulled over( which I had an issue with because the first day the sheets I had had urine stains on them) after I returned back to the room I asked if someone could come change my sheets. When I returned I asked the front desk if it was taken care of and they stated yes (what they didnt know is that I put a quarter in the middle of the bed under the covers). When I came to the room it was still there. The entire I was there no one vacuum the floor and I had to call everyday to ask for towels - the minimum required towels was not left in my room after cleaning it. I had a few questions and concerns for the manager Patrickbut he blew me off, loud talking me, his exact words were you did this so deal with it. Tuesday morning I attempt email to contact the manager Slade about the situation just to let him know that my bank stated they never received the authorization to reverse funds but he never called me back and I called him at 8:22 am. Yes I went down to the front desk and Jaime took care of it but he was avoiding me because he did not want to handle the situation. His exact words were you would have to call Patrick because he knows the situation and I dont have anything to do with it since he already knows the story. The crazy thing is I actually love this hotel but I wont ever be staying here again when I come to New Orleans. Talk about unprofessional and unable to handle a situation! By the way if I could give a negative 22 on the score I would. All weekend I was suppose to be enjoying the festivities for my birthday but I had to continuously run up behind Drury Inn for answers. What if I didnt have any cash on me how was I going to be able to get back home Im so disgusted by it ALL.",

We arrived at the hotel before lunchtime, and were pleasantly surprised to be able to go straight up to our room. The young woman who checked us in (Jamie) was so welcoming and friendly, we felt at home instantly. She even gave us a great recommendation for lunch, which we took, and enjoyed. Our room was on the 6th floor. It was large and well set out. We had 2 comfortable double beds , an armchair, desk, large screen TV, fridge, coffee maker and toiletries. The included breakfast was plentiful. Not a huge choice, but we always found something we enjoyed. It was busy during our stay so some mornings it was hard to find anywhere to sit, but one thing I will mention is the manager(s) were always making sure tables were cleaned briskly, so the wait was never too long. I found seeing management level doing this task and mingling with the people staying at the hotel a really nice touch. They always made time to ask about your day, and seemed to genuinely be interested in what you had to say. The nightly 'kickback' was another nice touch. We usually just had a nibble on the chips or popcorn,as had already eaten enough during the day, but it was fun to meet fellow holiday makers and hear about where they were from, or ideas of what to do around New Orleans. All in all I can not fault this hotel at all. Well done Drury Inn New Orleans for a efficiently run hotel with welcoming and friendly staff. Keep up the great work.",

                "text": "We stayed here because there was a group on and I am a Mariott Rewards Elite member, AND I have stayed at MANY residence inn's across the US.This was a great location, right off the expressway and MINUTES away from most things in Dallas. We arrived and there was a little confusion on our room, but it was fixed, we were put into a one bedroom suite as we had reserved that had a door (we brought kids with us) and that fixed the problem, the night staff was very accommodating to our request.Breakfast was good, had a nice selection (basic eggs, sausage, OJ, Milk, Cereal, Waffles etc) ONE tip I could give the hotel is GET ANOTHER WAFFLE MAKER! Everyone LOVED the texas shaped waffles but had to wait forever to make one since there was just one of them! They also serve a dinner type meal M-Tu-Wed, which while we didn't get to try is a nice perk for business travelers watching their expense accounts.I read some other reviews and can say that while this isn't a 2014 newly built property it really is in great shape, wear and tear here and there but nothing that was really out of the ordinary from other hotels, there were no stains on the floors, no holes in walls, doors worked great, the noise outside the halls and outside were nothing bad and no weird smells!The pool was a little highly chlorinated and I think someone might have just not known how much to really put in, but it was a heated pool and the hot tub wasn't working at the time, but keep in mind that it was 40 degrees the day before and just into the mid 60's so I am sure it was just opening season.Also one tip I would say is bring your own pillows if you can, I did read on another review where someone said the pillows were small, yes they are and hard! The beds were comfortable but I would recommend the hotel upgrade and replace all those little tiny rocks (pillows).I think the front desk pulls double duty for housekeeping as a few requests that we requested never happened like an extra blanket and a few towels brought to our room but I could tell the front desk staff was working their hardest so I let it slide and just dealt with it. Over all we had a very nice stay, and this is a property I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay, centrally located and with a nice friendly staff.Thank you so much for the kind and generous words. We appreciate your high praise for our staff and hotel. We are always looking for ways to improve our offerings. Currently we are finishing our exterior updates, including new gardens. Please join us again soon, we are very family friendly. The concerns you provided have also been addressed. Thank you so much. Lynn Martin, General Manager",

After all was said and done the first time, the GM sent me 2 free night vouchers to use at any Residence Inn in the country. That was all well and good and I thought I was done with my bad stay. But those vouchers came back to haunt me as I went to use them in St Louis and I was told that marriott had stopped using those 2 years ago and they were no good. How embarrassing! The people in St Louis were great. Very helpful with the situation. I'd recommend never staying here again. In the end they ending up paying for my night in St Louis and giving me some points. Doesn't make up for the embarrassing situation. I even called marriott corporate in regards to the situation. Thank you so much for taking time to help us to understand what happened to you. Please accept our apology as a team. The challenge you experienced in St Louis was handled beautifully by their staff and followed up by our Leadership as they paid for the room nights directly.

While one was sleeping in the bedroom, the other slept on the couch. We had attempted to pull out the sleeper sofa, but decided against it because we found cookie crumbs and other items underneath the mattress. The couch itself didn't look that clean, so I bought new linen and he slept on it instead. There was the hassle of using the key card everywhere, but when it comes to safety, I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was also the issue of how our room was being paid, we secured the deposit with a credit card, but when we got there, we wanted to pay with cash. But everything was quickly cleared up with a phone call to the manager. Overall, our stay there was pleasant. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for taking time to share your experience with us. We consistently work to address the concerns our guests have shared.

My only suggestion would be that if you are traveling down specifically to go to Disney World, you might want to consider how much your taxi rides will cost from the hotel to the Disney properties. While all of the maps we looked at said the hotel was only 3-5 miles from Disney, each of our cab rides cost between 25-30, depending on which park we were at that day. The hotel does have a shuttle to Epcot, but is limited. This would have been a great location if we had brought our car, but was a little remote when just relying on taxis. Overall, a great hotel, just consider its location!",

It's right on the edge of the GT campus and directly across from the campus bookstore (lots of swag available) it's within walking distance of a MARTA stop, and the busy downtown Peachtree/Centennial area is about a mile away, which translates into a quick taxi ride or one subway stop away. The area felt safe, and the hotel was clean and the staff pleasant. It's not a luxury hotel, but the price is among the best in the area.Thank you for the nice review. Our location lends itself to a variety of attractions, local restaurants, sporting venues and of course our location on the GT campus is unmatched in the market.

Put it back to how it was please NHH! There's a sweet little Italian bistro attached to it which seemed to be quite busy. The rooms were very clean and very comfortable. Reception staff were all really lovely and helpful. We'll definitely stay here again when in SF. The location too was ideal - a few blocks from Union Square - very central.",

Old style elevator so a bit hard to operate if your hands are full of luggage. Staff very friendly. Our room key kept not working. Other than that, it was an average stay. Good for the price if you want a place to crash for the night. If you have a lot of luggage, you will need a bigger room, as the king side bed, tv cabinet, bar fridge take up all the room.",

I just can't believe that they didn't at least try to fix it so that it stays open so that you can get in with luggage into elevator.I have to say it was a struggle to get in. NOT FUN!! The room was clean but very tight. I had a full bed and my luggage was on the other half of the bed. No room to put luggage anywhere but on the bed. Good thing I was on my own. Sink was in the bedroom. We are sorry that overall, you did not love your stay with us. We are pleased to provide clean, comfortable accommodation at a very competitive rate in San Francisco, which is notoriously expensive, and we are sorry that we and our property were unable to meet your expectations.

It is an old historic building with a lot of character but we did find our room to be very cramped particularly compared to everything else we stayed in on our trip. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly and breakfast was fine. The stair carpets were pretty dirty but as decorating works were underway I guess they're due for cleaning or changing once this has finished.The only other moan I have about this hotel is the pet policy ( it allows them). This is a compact inner city hotel with no outside space and seems unsuitable for pets ( dogs usually). When we were there a guest brought their dog into the breakfast room and later the same dog dumped a pile of you know what on the stairs. Yes this is down to an irresponsible owner but does show that a review of this policy may be needed.Would I go back again, you bet, even with the negatives it's good value and SF is a great city but next time I'll remember my hat, scarf, coat and gloves!",

Sadly, the area is not the best (within one block east south there are considerable numbers of poor unfortunate people living on the sidewalk, in tents, in cardboard boxes and cars). Although, we did not have any trouble whatsoever we did witness open (injected) drug use on the street. Some may call it edgy or off the tourist track. Certainly not a place for families with young children to visit. During our visit we met a retired SF Social worker who told us Hyde St. (300s) is one of the dirtiest locations in the city and a good many of this former clients came from around that area.The hotel building (c.1904) was clean inside and the staff more than helpful. Out first room, on the fourth floor, although a double, was a disappointment very small and cramped, no draw space, tiny shower room, single glazing, overlooking the main street, very noisy (there is an Emergency Hospital directly opposite with vehicles coming in though-out the night).Our second room (floor two) was much larger, with ample cupboard/draw space and a bath and was situated at the rear of the building clean, but, again a little tired.There are a few places to eat nearby again, some care would be needed, not to go down the wrong street.The nearest public transport (Cable Car on the California line) is two blocks to the north and a 20minute ride will connect you with the downtown financial district.Pros: Price!Cons: Location.Visit Again: No, sadly, the adjacent area is too distressed.We were pleased to host you during your stay in San Francisco, and we hope that you enjoyed your trip to the city. It is also good to hear that the hotel itself was good, and we trust that you rested well. We know that the homelessness that is evident throughout the city can be very disconcerting for those who are not used to it, and we are sorry that you found aspects of this to be so off-putting. Please know that this is replicated throughout the city. Thankfully, our guests are never approached by people, and despite appearances, our area is very safe. Our building and some of our furniture are quite old, but we trust that you noticed the wonderful standard of cleanliness and upkeep that we maintain, and we hope that this did not detract from your stay too much. Overall, we are sorry that you did not enjoy your time here more. Best wishes, Hotel Management",

Breakfast is very basic consisting of some fruits , pastries and very cheap bread .We would recommend eating out to a nice bakery on the same street called Flour and company and the coffee is of greater quality .The staff was friendly and helpful .The room itself had an odor of humidity but once inside could get used to. A small fridge and micro-wave oven was offered in the room .The room and hotel are very nicely decorated with an abundance of moldings ,carpets ,wall paper and is Air conditioned equipped .I would recommend it to the traveler on a budget .",

We were struggling for two hours to locate another hotel ..using both Expedia (who owed us big!) and our own efforts... and no one came thru. Just as we were going to give up, there was a shift change at Reception and our savior Lorenzo came on. Thru some magic, he was able to provide us with two lovely rooms for the night!! He is a truly charming and compassionate...an excellent employee and human being!!The rooms were nicely decorated with very comfortable beds. Old San Francisco feel! Would stay there again!Hi Alan, We were pleased to provide you with a safe refuge from the fires, and we are pleased to have provided you with suitable accommodation. If you are staying with us, or indeed any hotel, again, do consider booking directly with the hotel, and you will have much less likelihood of issues arising with your booking and with your check-in on future visits. We hope that you will visit us for a more pleasant reason in the future. Best wishes, Hotel Management",

Booked on hotels website for 5 nights and payed for room including parking for 134 plus taxes a night. Stayed to be close to AA center which is about a 600 metre walk or the hotels shuttle will drop you off. Used the kitchen in room even baking some biscuits in the convection microwave :) Two very comfy queen beds and also a pull out sofa bed, as there was three of us we could have a bed each which was a nice surprise. We were there the week of Boston Bombings and West explosion so spent alot of time in hotel watching events unfold so on the downside I think this place is so much like a home away from home we probably didnt see as much of Dallas as we would have if the room wasnt so comfortable. Internet connection was BAD BAD BAD in room 422. Very nice touch to add the evening social of nibbles and beer and wine four nights a week. Glad we actually went and checked out in person (we usually dont) as the parking was added to our bill when it had been paid for with the room. All in all a pleasant experience.",

Hotel has not changed.Breakfast was good, and staff has been very nice and pleasant. Free ber and wine for 1 hour from 530pm - 630pm. Nice light evening meal, but nothing spectacular.Hotel corridors in summer time were over 80, and room did not drop in temperature below 76. Called front desk to complain, and was sent to offsite hotel operator who told me she couldn't do anything.Pool looks dirty, but it just is in a bad need of a resurfacing. Pool is locked at 10pm. Shuttle will drop you off for dinner, but shuts down at 7pm, so you have to pay for a cab to return to the hotel. They have free parking, so if you're driving, this is a cheaper than the hotels downtown.For the amount of money that we spent, I would have much rather stayed at a nicer hotel.Thank you for taking time to let us know about your stay here at the Hyatt house. Yes about 4 years ago the hotel went from the Bradford Suites to a Hyatt. I do appoligize about the phone system, it was originally designed to have every room with its own number so when you dial 0 you get an outside operator, because the hotel was designed more as an extended stay property. We are in the process of upgrading the phone system so our guest will no longer have that issue. As far as the AC we have since gotten the hallway units replaced and I can say it feela so much better. Our rooms have a senor controled T Stat, trying to be more energy aware. I hope that the next time you are in Dallas you will come by and see the changes.Thank you again for the welcomed comments,Jeff JonesGeneral Manager",

I stayed a week for business but I have friends and family in Texas so I had a really nice visit as well. My parents stayed with me the first couple of nights and they enjoyed the bed while I slept on the couch which was not uncomfortable. My parents relaxed and enjoyed the room while I was at work and when I returned in the evening we would go have a nice dinner at nearby restaurants. The kitchen area was nice for making coffee in the morning and the refrigerator came in handy for breakfast items in the morning or leftovers from dinner the night before. I didn't feel well the 3rd day I was there and my parents had already left. I didn't want to go out for dinner so I headed down to check out the happy hour. They had wine and snacks and light meal options which was great! I chose some soup and crackers and went back to bed and felt better by morning. I liked the pool area but didn't get a chance to enjoy it. The gift shop had sandwiches and other drinks and snacks, my sandwich was very dry and I didn't like it that much but I'm sure a different choice would have made a difference. The parking is very old school with a big heavy gate on large springs that raise to allow you into the covered multilevel parking, which they do charge you for. Overall I liked this hotel. The room was nice, the bed and pillows were comfy, nice desk area for nightly paperwork, the toothpaste they provided came in handy since I ran out and the food and beverage was a nice treat!",

The show provided a shuttle from the hotel entrance right to McCormick place, so that is a big bonus, as I DO NOT like to drive around Chicago anywhere NEAR morning or afternoon rush. The valets were very nice and quick with your car, but 45 per night for parking seems way overpriced. This alone would cause me to look elsewhere, if I were personally paying for a stay. The Taylor street restaurants were many and varied, Within walking distance (few blocks) had a few decent meals there, but nothing to rave about. This area is a little too close to (actually considered) the west side for my taste. While jogging a few miles, it it easy to see the areas that you should not venture into, simply turn around and head back towards the university. Did not eat at in-house restaurant, prices are about what you would expect from a hotel bar / restaurant i.e. overpriced, but convenient.",

                "text": "We stayed four four nights in July on a mini vacation. The room was clean and in good shape however it was a bit dated. I got the feeling that the clientele may have been suspect in the past as there were signs informing you that you'll be charged if this or that is missing form the room. The AC controls require you to put a room key in a slot next to the door which is odd and our room the AC was out on night one. Maintenance quickly fixed this which ended up bypassing this key card interlock so it was a non issue. The wifi in the room was unusable due to low signal. Not sure if it is better by the pool as I never tried but that was disappointing. The location is excellent for beach access although at night it's not exactly family friendly on the street side of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and responsive to our needs. The common areas were very nice and clean. They had beach toys for use and showers with hot water at the entrance form the beach so you can wash off the beach in comfort. The pool and hot tub worked as they should albeit a bit out dated and the poo was in need of repair. No big deal but the water line tile is in need of replacement. That said the pool clean and clear and maintained daily. The hotel supplies towels for the both the pool and the beach which is a really nice feature just make sure the beach towels come back as if they are missing they are 50 each. Overall the hotel was nice, the staff was excellent, and the location very good. Updated rooms with better (read quieter) AC units and useable wifi would garner an excellent review. That said we will look to this property again next year on our annual beat the heat of Phoenix trip to San Diego.Thank you for the review! We're sorry to hear about the WiFi - someone regularly checks the signals, so we'll go back and make sure something wasn't missed. And rest assured, charging guests who take home our nice beach towels or bath robes is standard in the industry - it has nothing to do with the type of clientele here at the hotel!It sounds like you had a very enjoyable vacation here in San Diego. You'll also be happy to know this fall we will continue renovations of our rooms, so when you're ready to escape the scorching desert temperatures next year, check us out again! See you soon!",

Due to airline issues, we arrived at 1:00 am, and they held our room for us and even gave us a river view at our request upon arrival. They gave us restaurant recommendations and helped out with getting around. We never felt like our questions were bothering them or they were too busy for us. They even helped us print our return flight tickets before leaving.We did not feel that the room was small at all, like we saw some others say. It was the same size as other hotel rooms we've been in. We loved the charm of the building, rather than being in a newly built hotel. We liked the accommodations in general. My only negative was our water pressure in the shower. It was practically nonexistent...I felt like Kramer on Seinfeld...took forever to do my hair afterwards.The location is AMAZING. Right in the middle of things and along the river. The L-train stop is nearby with several lines that meet there. It is right across from Trump Tower (take that as you may, I suppose). Like others have said, you can walk to so much. Overall, amazing experience. We will go back.",

Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel.",

Rooms are smaller than what you would find in other hotels, but there is so much to do in Chicago we really only spent time in our room when we were sleeping. It is right on the BigBus tour line, so we found it really easy to get around town if we were headed somewhere further away than we wanted to walk.Thank you, Kelsey W, for choosing to stay at the River Hotel during your New Year celebration in Chicago.

I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.",

MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here.

                "text": "We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel.",

                "text": "I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here.",

Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins!

If these things are disturbing to you, don't stay here. If you crave peace and quiet, four star ambiance and price, you should go up to the Peninsula.

We appreciated the free wi-fi and coffee in our room as well. Our room was clean and quiet at night. Jay was very friendly and helpful at check in. Everyone we met who worked at this hotel was very nice. Best of all, is the hotel location! The River Walk is right outside the hotel. It is a great place to run or walk if you want, or to just sit and watch all the boats going by. We walked everywhere from this hotel. Great nightlife, museums, Eataly and Millennium Park are all close by. The restaurant Bella Bacino, located in the hotel lobby, had an amazing kale salad and a lighter Italian pizza that was also very good. There's also an outside patio, too. Also, the Corner Bakery Cafe is just down the street. We definitely will be coming back! This is our new favorite location in Chicago.Thank you, travelbuff101, for your thoughtful review of the River Hotel.

This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well.

We would come back.The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was spotless. Housekeeping was accommodating about extra towels and our other requests.The free breakfast was great with a nice selection of hot and cold items, and the Mickey waffles were a big hit with my daughter. I was, however, disappointed with the lack of fresh fruit. The only choices were apples and bananas, and they ran out early and weren't restocked. If similar properties in Canada can give fresh fruit in the winter, I was surprised that my only choice in Florida in the spring was apples and bananas. There is a fellow working dining room clearing tables in the mornings named Jean Louis. He is warm, friendly, and a real treat to interact with. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned another fellow who seemed to do the cooking who wasn't really friendly.We only used the free supper once during our stay. It was adequate, but not excellent. We have stayed at Homewood Suites in Carlsbad and Anaheim, and the meals can vary in quality by location. The real benefit of this free meal is that it is easy and convenient when you are traveling with children who are exhausted after a day at one of the parks. If I was traveling as a couple, I'd probably eat evening meals elsewhere.The free wifi is strong, and we were able to stream Netflix most of the time we tried, even when the hotel got really full later on in the week.The pool is really nice, but could use more deck chairs. They were hard to come by in the afternoon. You can get room service and bar service from the other hotel that shares the pool area. The fitness center is large (probably because two hotels share it) and has a number of cardio machines. Two of them were not working while we were there. The basketball court is a nice touch, and was well used the whole time we stayed.The shuttle service to Epcot Center is a nice touch, but I wish it ran constantly. There are three times you can catch a ride over to Epcot in the morning, and three times you can catch a ride back in the late afternoon/evening, and that's it. I'd like to be able to come and go more often so I could get to the parks early before they are too busy, then come back for a nap, and return for the evening fireworks. The shuttle service here won't let that happen. Because the Disney parks are so close, renting a car and paying to park at Disney is certainly an option that is made easier by the free parking at this hotel.",

But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.",

Nothing special. The room was overpriced by about double for the property.Breakfast was fine, the buffet is priced similarly to other Marriotts. Coffee was average.Location is near Little Italy and the Medical school. Not an awesome part of town and the property matches the neighborhood (not awesome). It's not the ghetto but there are definitely nicer looking areas in Chicago.I will not stay here next time I'm in Chicago. It may be the closest Marriott property to my client but there's plenty of public transportation in downtown Chicago, you can stay other nicer places that aren't over-priced (I recommend Blackstone Renaissance!)",

I had a small room, which was fine, but it was just very bland. The bed covering is one of those bad synthetic things, there were only two limp pillows on the bed stuff like that. There wasnt even an iron or board in the room. The place just felt very cheap and kind of sad. My rate was 200, which was less than other properties the weekend I stayed. But in retrospect, I should have paid an extra 30 to stay at a place that felt more upbeat. My only plusses were: its location, the fact that I was able to check in early, and free internet. Those arent strong enough factors, though next time Im in Chicago, Ill stay somewhere else. C-minus.",

It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!",

There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price.",

She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city!

Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel.

There is no tub, just a shower stall. Small bathroom. But again, fit our needs. As other reviews have said, the sheets are very scratchy. This was my only complaint. The location is great, right in the middle of downtown, convenient to everything. It was just about 3 blocks from our El stop. The restaurant downstairs was pretty good, and very convenient for breakfast. We found the staff polite and helpful, though our interactions with them were limited. The fitness room was sufficient, the machines were fairly new. It was not fancy, but the equipment was good quality. It is a small space. The filtered water and bottles on each floor was a nice touch. We would go back.",

If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often.",

I didn't love that you have to go to a utility closet outside of your room to grab a ironing board and iron, but not a big deal -- kind of unique and boutiquey, I guess. This is definitely a unique hotel and modern hotel.The water pressure in the shower was really bad though, unfortunately. It took absolutely forever to rinse since there was nearly no water coming out -- not to mention the cold and uncomfortable feeling of being wet and cold without enough warm water rushing out. Why do so many hotels have water pressure issues This always drives me nuts -- it is so hit and miss too. One hotel will have great pressure in the city, and the next horrible.. I wish more reviewers spoke to water pressure haha. Or is that just me who cares about thatThe location is excellent -- right on the river and close by everything you need. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.I unfortunately got a room with no view so I cannot comment on the view, but I am sure the view would have been incredible from that location, if you had a river view. My window was quite small though, so not sure how they are on the other side of the building. Overall, if you're staying in Chicago, you will likely enjoy your stay at this hotel. It's basic and does the job. Very clean, modern and standard. One of the biggest things that determines my feelings on a hotel is the bathroom / shower experience.. its like make and break for me haha! So, unless they fix the water pressure issues, I likely won't be staying here again.Hello cformosa4,We truly appreciate your visit and thoughtful review. We are sorry to hear about the water pressure and will certainly have the room inspected and improved straight away. We are well known for our location, service and ease of use for the business traveler... so glad your found this as well.I sincerely hope you will give us another try on your next visit!",

We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity.

                "text": "As being a guest in Chicago, you can afford the luxury of spending a couple of hours on the architectural tour through downtown Chicago. The first building they tell you about is the River hotel. Situated opposite the Trump tower, you get a feeling of the grandeur of the 1920s, when the hotel was build. It must have had the same strange feeling, you now get from the Trump tower. Ugly, grotesque, aiming at the very rich and symbolizing something which does not exist and proves to be a dream. While we now call the building historical nostalgia with its weird toptower as of floor 24, the hotel offers a mixture of the old and the new. The old is the buildings shape and elevators, the various signs and sometimes not well maintained emergency staircases. The new offering a business floor, the tiny modernized reception room, the good quality Wi-Fi and free water they serve. And it is this indecisiveness which makes or breaks this hotel. Either do the modern streak or go completely back into the history of 1920's. We were staying on a high floor and really getting in the top of the building, you are offered small floors with smaller rooms. Due to the height, rooms tend to be windy even with closed windows. The room was ok, but why this old fashioned ugly bathroom Why do they forget a bedside table and when asked for and promised, the thing, it never showed up Why have a decent desk but not enough electricity points To be fair the prices are reasonable for downtown Chicago but the hotel just misses the finesses to make it to a four star. The view from the window was amazing but the cold wind chilled up the room sometimes to an uncomfortable temperature. My advice would be stay low.Hello LowieSantiagoChile,Thank you for providing us with feedback on your stay.

The safe isn't electronic so you need to go to the reception pay 5 and get a key. Slightly worryingly the receptionist told me they only have a certain number of keys for the safes. As mentioned the streets close by are full of homeless, drunks and junkies. That said, there isn't too much the hotel can do about that.The rooms are not too bad, enough space and have a walk-in wardrobe to hang your clobber. Despite my earlier comments the hotel is central enough to get around the main attractions in a short taxi journey. A good place to stay if you aren't planning on spending much time in the hotel.Thank you for taking the time to provide a review of your stay. We are glad that you enjoyed our central location, and found our hotel so convenient for exploring the city. We are sorry that there were some elements of your stay which you did not enjoy. Please rest assured that although our lift is old, it is quite safe. We are sorry that you felt some areas of the hotel need updating but we do appreciate your feedback on this and will take your comments into consideration. Best wishes, Hotel Management",

The next night we chose to pay for the valet service at 35.00 a night. because once we did more driving around we realized it was a very bad neighbourhood, not child friendly or even adult friendly for that matter . The hotel offered coffee and juice and the morning and this was not very good. Overall was not enjoyable to stay",

The reception staff were polite, if a little unapproachable, we had to discover all the facilities of the hotel by roaming around....only after 5 daysof braving the homeless people to use the phone in the street, did we discover the payphone and vending machines. They could really use a map of the hotel, or at least show you the facillities on arrival. Our room was comfy and clean, the bed was a brilliant size and so nice to crawl into after scaling the hills all day!! The maid service was excellent. The down sides were apparent straight away, our room was facing the corner of a busy junction, on the 6th floor....the constant traffic woke us up frequently as did the fire trucks which used their sirens freely and at least twice in the night, every night!!!!! The area is dodgy looking but actually not as bad as we anticipated, true there are homeless people everywhere and the street cleaners dont seem to venture that far, but we never had any trouble ( in fact i encountered more scary situations in the lift with non english speaking leery men who find it 'funny' to wedge you into a corner...) most homeless people were friendly or kept to themselves. Take a right as you come out the hotel, and you'll find a fantastic sandwhich shop QUIZNOS, right again and a cinema,diner and cocktail bar which are all really nice yet not mentioned in our guide. Lovely trip overall!!!",

Decor is okay, rooms are small, floors/walls are quite thin. I could here the activities and conversations of those in nearby rooms. Insufficient ventilation in bathroom causing serious fog for hours. Area is heavily populated with homeless people with a community centers across the street from hotel. Wifi was horrible. No microwave. Refrig in select rooms. Elevator issues due to being so outdated. No breakfast, but coffee available 24/7 in lobby along with knats. Again front desk guys and housekeeping were very nice. Easy walk to union square, clubs, bars and food. Management really needs to invest in updates to the property's plumbing, wifi, guest accommodations to include refrig/microwaves and the environment immediately around the hotel as much as possible. Some guest room views are an open space shared with the apt complex next door and displays trash and a view into tenants' apts. I paid too much for my experience.We are obviously very pleased with your report of the great service that you received at our hotel. We do occupy an older building most of the buildings in this area are quite old, but we work tirelessly to ensure quality standards are upheld for our guests.

Here are some tips/info you should know: It is right across the street from a facility where the homeless get services they are always hanging out there. The closest BART station, Civic Center, pops up in the middle of what could be called a homeless tent city. As a woman with 3 children traveling with me, all wheeling airport bags, we were very out of place walking to the hotel the kids were terrified. I felt much safer walking to the hotel from the west side-Van Ness street where there is great access to public transport.I wouldn't rule out going back to the Monarch on another trip if I needed a budget hotel, but I wouldn't bring kids there I'm not sure I'd go alone.Erica H,Thank for such a well-thought out and kind review.

The biggest problem was that the area was loud at night with the homeless and druggies talking/yelling until 1am.In the morning the homeless were very visable and at night,I would not want to be coming in late if you are on your own. SO the hotel it self is worth the savings,but the area I something to really really consider and I am a city girl.Stay in little Italy or near the Warf,these are the cleaner and safer areas.

Few people on the street corner talking/signing and praying to themselves. Was slightly intimidating walking pass in the evenings. The valet took 20 /30 mins to collect the car when requested during the stay- though the staff were helpful. Rooms don't have a coffee machine either.

Surprise - the gentleman at the front desk moved rooms around and checked us in! We were staying on my husband's business points for 4 days. Hyatt knows how to treat it's points customers right unlike that other big H chain where we find ourselves in the worst rooms they have. This was an 18th floor room with a view towards the space needle. We had a room with 2 full beds but it worked as our 21 year old daughter was with us. We did place a towel in front of the door one night as some hallway noise was coming under the door but it seemed to be related to all the Baseball Fans staying at the hotel and arriving back at once.The bathroom had great amenities, a soaking tub and a spotless glass shower. The safe in the closet accomodated the laptop computer and we had plenty of hangers. The dresser was a little small since it accomodates the mini-bar. Right after check in someone knocked and asked if we had everythng we needed and she was very friendly.The doormen were knowledgeable and gave us good directions and information on the area. The Starbucks just outside the lobby was slow as molasses but friendly just not efficient! The Grayline bus to the airport leaves at 15 to and 15 after the hour from the west side of the hotel. This was a very good location as we went to ACT theater one night, walked over and back to Pikes Place Market another and to the Seattle Art Museum.

The room was the exact same room with the exact same view as a friend had on the 21st floor. What I will say is the bathroom is fabulous. Soaking tub and separate shower, large vanity, robes. But the quality and quantity of the towels didn't live up to the rest of the bathroom. FACILITIESThere is no restaurant, no bar, nothing. There is a Starbucks around the corner. Its very odd given that the hotel has a small conference center. There is a Ruth and Chris' Steak House next door but the bar there is very small. And a major downside is that the lobby smells of cooking meat from about 3:00 on.Great work out facility. One of the best I've seen.Executive lounge is okay but doesn't have the amenities of Hilton, marriott, Westin etc. BREAKFASTWe had a AAA package that was suppose to include a full breakfast. It turned out to be that a very small continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge with an additional chaffing dish of eggs and a meat CUSTOMER SERVICEIt was okay during the stay but had major trouble with my bill. I got charged 3x the room upgrade. I called in to customer service and told that I was mistaken on the cost of the upgrade and that there was no way I could have gotten information to the contrary because it would mean a flaw in the reservation system. Fortunately, I still had a copy of the e-mail that showed the correct amount. When I sent it in I did not get an apology or anything even though I explained how challenging it was to have to deal with credits etc. with my company.

                "text": "We stayed here because my husband had a meeting that was being held at this hotel. I had great expectations based on reviews I read on trip advisor and the beautiful pictures on the website. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. It is a fine hotel. As I said in the title it's serviceable. Maybe my standards are too high but I felt there were certain things lacking that you would expect at a top notch hotel. We checked in late at night and the place was deserted. We waited at the front desk for a few minutes and then ran into someone sweeping the floor who then went to find someone to check us in. It was odd. We finally got to our room and I say finally because the hotel is laid out in such a way as to be somewhat confusing until you figure out what's going on. So it took us awhile to get to the room. We were on the 3rd floor but there was no elevator so we had to make several trips to get to the room with our luggage. I would hope that there is an easier way if you are incapable of stairs and luggage but it wasn't readily accessible to us. The hallways look dated and we commented on how outside almost every room were champagne glasses. I assume people were done with them and put them outside the rooms for pickup but why they were there at midnight was beyond me and I'm talking the majority of rooms. We had to make sure not to knock into them with our luggage and shatter glasses. This was a daily occurrence. We certainly didn't get champagne so not sure what that was about. On the plus side the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were clean. However, the pillowcases were too short for the pillows so they hang out (quirk of mine but I hate that in a hotel). I like the pillow to be completely covered. The towels were incredibly soft but very small. Again, another quirk but I think in a nice hotel there should be large towels and more than just two per day. There was one bar of soap to wash hands with and we like to have one for the shower instead of the bath gel. So asked two days in a row to please have an extra bar of soap. By day three we actually received them. The grounds are beautiful with lots of places to sit, but none of the sitting areas were actually comfortable. Some comfortable sitting areas would be welcome. Lastly, we had easter brunch at the Mustang and burros restaurant as we were meeting family from LA. They drove down for this 70 per person brunch. The brunch was fine but in no way merited 70 per person. Had a hard time getting refills on coffee. Never got offered any other drinks, asked for bowls but never came. Just kind of disorganized and the seating outside is awkward because the tables are low and the chairs are high and you are sort of hunched over. I hate that this sounds like a complaining review because I usually don't like to do that but I just felt annoyed that I flew to San Diego which is a 4 hour flight for me, to keep my husband company at his meeting and in hopes of having a relaxing stay at a beautiful hotel and just felt it was not worth the time and money it took to get there.Dear Vicki000,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia while your husband was at our resort on business. It was a pleasure to have you as a guest and we're pleased that you enjoyed the beautiful grounds and comfortable accommodations. We do apologize, however, that certain aspects of your stay with us did not meet your expectations. We value your feedback and have shared your comments with the appropriate management teams. We do hope to welcome you back to Estancia in the future for a stay that surpasses all of your expectations.",

Of more buildings Not sure I needed to see more of the buildings.Five stars for me on this!Overall, and very nice hotel, very clean, well appointed rooms, plus the corner suites are very large, with a separate sitting area, bathroom, and bedroom. All very nice.Hotel reception was nice, very nice young man who checked us in, good sense of humor (which is very important, that he understands my jokes!). Bell man could have acknowledged my wife and I walking through, but decided to stare blankly out the door... Not sure about that (long day I guess).Sampled the attached restaurant for Happy Hour, which was very nice.Wish our Sta-Cation could have lasted longer, but we needed to head home.",

                "text": "We booked the Hyatt for our weekend in Seattle to see Steve Martin and Martin Short.The hotel is dog friendly and in walking distance of the Paramount theatre where the show was at.The parking isn't the best here but it's Seattle, so it's expected. We paid 35 for overnight parking. Once you get parked just walk everywhere, I love walking around Seattle.The only complaint I had was the pet fee changing from the time I booked it until the time we actually stayed. The fee had gone up 50. I didn't complain or say anything because I just didn't feel like having a dispute about it. I also wish they'd had an area for the dogs to do their business, luckily I always carry poop bags, but my Dog had to go very suddenly on the street because I couldn't find a green space close enough, so I just picked it up of course.I guess with big cities it's harder to have an outdoor area for pets.Now to all the great things, which was pretty much everything.The lobby was beautiful, nice lighting, everything was clean, there were large hallways and huge ceilings.Our check in was quick, easy and friendly.We were given a room on the 29th floor with a great view of the city.The room had huge windows, it was a really clean room, spacious and beautiful.The bed was really comfy and also very clean.The Bathroom was massive and I really mean that, it has a gorgeous soaking tub, walk in shower, toilet and vanity area. You have lots of amenities with this hotel.There is a nice hallway space and an awesome do not disturb button that turns a light on and you don't have to hang something on your door, loved that.We had food and drink options that were attached to the hotel in the front, which is always nice for a quick and easy option.We ordered room service with our TV remote. The breakfast that came was delicious, very prompt and with friendly service.We slept amazingly with the fantastic bed and black out shades.When we came back into our hotel on the Saturday afternoon/evening before the show we got on the elevator with a Seattle Mariner, that was pretty cool.Everything about our experience here was perfect from the moment we arrived to the moment we sadly left.This was a bit of a splurge but I hope that one day we can stay here again.I also wanted to add that every staff member I encountered was always friendly to myself, my DH and our Dog.Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle for the show.",

The hotel itself is ideally situated in the heart of town, just a short walk to Pikes Market and very close to shops and cinemas. We also found the staff very friendly and polite. We dined at the steakhouse and although we were not expecting it, it was fine dining and of course reasonably expensive, but definitely worth it. The steaks were divine! If I came back to Seattle again, I would definitely stay here. We loved it! The only small drawback that we didn't notice until one of our last days was that there was construction across the street. Luckily it didn't keep us awake. All in all I would definitely recommend staying here.",

                "text": "I stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Seattle Tuesday through Saturday with my wife. The hotel is beautiful, trendy with very good service. It is just across from the convention center and has a Ruths Chris (that even serves breakfast), a Starbucks, NY-style deli, and Blue C Sushi attached. A Cheesecake factory is on the corner of the building but not attached to the Hyatt.The doorman, valets, bellman (especially Jazz), front desk and maids were all very good. We chose a club room which served a decent breakfast but seemed to skimp on the variety of food items for the evening appetizer drink session. The club room did have very nice computer stations, TVs, chairs and couches, and a fantastic view.The room was certainly large enough with a very comfortable king-size bed. What disappointed my wife and me was that the desk (i.e. the place to put your computer, cell phone, etc.) only had one available wall plug, hidden and inconveniently located behind the desk. Most hotel desks have lamps with electrical outlets in their bases, or several outlets purpose-built into the desk. Not so with our desk just a plain desk and one hidden plug. Also, only every third or fourth floor had an ice machine. When I needed ice (which was daily so my wife could ice her post-op foot) I had to go from the my 25th floor room to the 28th floor - or call for ice and wait.They also only provided two glasses for the room and no paper/plastic cups. We prefer to use two glasses for drinks and have two in the BR. When we would bring glasses down from the club to put on the bathroom counter, they were consistently gone in the morning. Moreover, the towels were remarkably thin and limp, not what youd expect from a high-end hotel and they only provided two hand towels and two not-so-large bath towels. (The towels at the Staybridge Inn and Hampton Inns where we also stayed on our trip were much larger and more plush and each gave us four of each.)We were surprised and disappointed that Hyatt would cut corners on the Club food, towels, and a decent computer desk. Otherwise, we had a nice stay and would consider staying there again.",

The workout space was heaven (and I usually hate working out but I enjoyed it here). You can also use the spa and workout space at the hyatt across the street which is even more extensive.We got free wifi too which is something you don't always get with business hotels. It is near the convention center which in some towns can be in a funky area of town. We were just a few blocks from Pike's Place Market, A good retail shopping district seemed to surround us and it was easy to get around.I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a more upscale stay.",

As stated in other reviews, the bathroom is almost as big as the bedroom... which is really great. Spent a lot of time in the tub!On the second day of our stay, the room next to us started sounding like a night club... around 4pm! After a quick peek, we realized it was a group of kids for Prom. Rather than deal with them later in the night we called downstairs and were moved immediately to the 26th floor. The room was slightly smaller, but definitely quiet! The staff was VERY helpful in our transition to rooms and the entire ordeal was over within a matter of minutes.The Grand Hyatt is very conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and the waterfront.

                "text": "Fourth of July is a time to hit the road and with 90-100 degree temps in Chicago, I went West for the cooler air of Seattle. When I was hotel shopping I saw that the Grand Hyatt's rates were identical to many others in the area, so I decided to jump in with them. After I booked, it gave me an option to try to upgrade to a suite for 39, so, I said What the hell! and went for it.After, arriving in Seattle and taking the rail line to downtown, I emerged and walked 2 blocks to the Grand Hyatt. The lobby was quiet, intimate and spacious. Cassie welcomed me and began to check me in. She confirmed she upgraded me to the Emerald suite and told me I really gotten a good deal! I hope so, I though to my self. I ended up on the top floor with an amazing view of the sound, as well as much of downtown.The suite was awesome. It is hard to describe such an amazing room, with the view and all. It just sort of takes your breath away for a minute and you just soak it all in. None of the pictures here do this property justice. If you like what you see, you will be even more impressed when you are there. The suite did not even look like a hotel room, but rather some nice apartment I only wish I could afford. There were plenty of knick knacks, art, books, etc, all over. The Grand bed was - well, grand! You almost never want to get out of it. The linens were amazing, the bath stocked with every essential. Even a separate bath gel in case a bubble bath was in order (which it was one night). With more than enough room for two, several additional people could easily fit it with out any problems. Everything was neat, clean, comfortable, and housekeeping did an amazing job each day!The real gem of the hotel with Grand Club on 27. Although, not a lot of snacks, there were free sodas and juice all throughout the day. Tom, our host in the evening is the jewel holding the crown together! Beyond friendly, fun, and always on top of everything, he genuinely seemed to care! He remembered several guests drink choices from night to night (He certainly remembered mine, and I saw him acknowledge and recognize others). This level of personal attention is what sets this place apart from the rest.Watching the game on TV in the lounge, sipping a cocktail and munching on some cheese and veggies, I was quite happy. Tom seemed able to converse with kids and adults alike. Making his guests smile and happy seems to come naturally for him. Also a wealth of information on places to go, and the best way to get there, it was like having a live Google to chat with!The location of this hotel means that you really do not need a car. You can walk just about any where or a short cab ride at most. Save your money - forgo the car (and parking) and enjoy this city. There is a Starbucks and Deli in the lobby and several other Starbucks within a few blocks, so access to coffee and food are not a worry. Plenty of shopping and all the great attractions (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc) nearby!I would certainly stay here again - even if it cost a little bit more! Pamper yourself - relax and enjoy Seattle from the Grand Hyatt - it will be a a Grand Memory for sure!I appreciate you taking the time to give feedback on all the aspects of your stay with us at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. I am thrilled to hear that you chose us to spend your Fourth of July holiday with and that you were able to experience all that our hotel has to offer. Our suites are spacious and equipped with everything you need so I was glad to hear how comfortable you were. As well, I will certainly pass along the compliments to Cassie and Tom - they are truly a valuable part of our team. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel!Lindye W.

                "text": "My first time visiting the city, and I am so glad I chose this hotel. I was in town for a marathon the city was hosting. I arrived a few days early so that I could tour the city as well as rest a bit. As with any walking friendly city, location is so important. Trust me, It was centrally located. In one day, I walked to the CenturyLink Field event center for the expo, visited the market, the needle, and hopped aboard a ferry. Upon my return, I had the choice of a relaxing bath in a spacious tub or a quick shower. Definitely after the marathon, that tub came in handy!!! I was able to sleep comfortably every night which was very important for my mindset. Every evening I would return to a clean room with everything I had requested. Housekeeping was very attentive. Also, there's a Starbucks inside the hotel as well as a place that makes hot sandwiches which came in very handy for my last minute carb fix. If ever in Seattle again, I'm staying here!!Thank you for your comments. We're so happy that you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of all the amenities to prep and decompress from your marathon. It's wonderful that you were also able to explore the city and even get on the water while you were here! We would love to have you back with us during your next visit to Seattle.Best Regards,Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager",

Pike Market is a short walk and you can even walk to the waterfront if you like. Check in service is excellent, the front desk and the hotel workers are always friendly and willing to help out. Room is very clean with a large bathroom. My only complaint is the ice machines are not located on all floors, although the hotel says they can someone up with some ice for you. Also the safe in the rooms are located on a high shelf in the closet, see pictures, if you were a short person not sure you could even use it.The hotel does not have its own restaurant, you need to walk next door to the Ruth Chris to eat, but they were open for breakfast. There is a Starbucks and a small convenience store near the hotel.Although the hotel had some minor issues, I would stay here again next time I visit Seattle.",

It took us at least 40 minutes. 3 people at the counter and only one of them was checking in anyone. We knew several of the people waiting in line. Two of them were sent to rooms that already had people in them. Then they had to come and wait in that 40 minute line again to get it straightened out. This sort of service is not what you would normally associate with a Grand Hyatt, especially with the rates they are charging. The Gold desk was not open and the concierge just sat there and did nothing to help either. The valet station was not operating smoothly either, both for check in and check out. All in all, the front of the house here needs some help.",

The room was comfortable and had nice amenities. Ruth Chris Steak House is attached to the hotel which serves fabulous meals. Expensive but very good quality. As with most Seattle hotels parking is very expensive-around 45 a day and even 30 to self park so our son picked us up when we arrived and then we took a town car when we had to return to the airport. 65 included tax and gratuity and was arranged by the hotel concierge, Molly, who was most helpful. She also told us about the train to the airport but when she said you have a half mile walk from the station to the airline counters we declined. Only around 3.00 so if the weather is good (ours wasn't) and you don't have a lot of packages (we did) it would be the way to go. You can catch the train only two blocks from the hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping, eating or theater going in Seattle. Very close and easy walking distance to major stores and lots of wonderful small ones. Also located next to the convention center so very convenient for that too. We were disappointed to come back from shopping at almost 2:00 and find our room had not been cleaned as yet. We also did not care for the heating system. It has a vent at the top of the wall and when it came on it blasted your head with cold air when you were in bed. Don't understand why it was cold as we had it on heat. These were the only two negatives and we would definitely stay again. Our room was very quiet except for when the idiots in the corner room next to us let their door slam about 12 times around midnight. I was just about to call the front desk when it stopped. They had a nice business center and allowed you to web check in for your flight for free but charge to use the internet.",

Room 2920 was comfortable and had a view towards the west with Elliott Bay in the background. You will hear noise from traffic below. I was also disappointed with the thin bath towels. You'd think a place this nice with these room rates would of offered better, thicker towels. The very large shower had some black mold in spots that contrasted with the white marble. Charging for bottled water seems cheap too. Self serve parking 30/day is a bit steep. Seems to me that they could give guests a discount on the parking fees.",

It was on the back side of the hotel (away from the Sound view), but it was a spacious room with the necessary accoutrements. The bed was comfortable, and the housekeeping staff was friendly. The club had a better spread than some other locations, and ample seating. Otherwise as far as restaurant outlets in the hotel, they had a Ruth's Chris (didn't go) and a deli/convenience store. There's a bunch of places within walking distance though, covering all types of cuisine, and it's very easy to get to the tourist attractions not too much of a jaunt to Safeco Field either.Would definitely recommend.",

Staff were overall great and helped us with a broken handle on our luggage. The only issue I have is why hotels in general only provide towels for two guests in a room that sleeps four We had asked for early booking, but the room was not ready. After a long flight I chose to wait in the lobby and it was awfully cold. My husband and son had left to attend a baseball game. When I got to the room after a two-hour wait, I then had to call down to get extra towels, as I knew there were not enough for all of us. We had a view of the space needle which was great. We were very pleased to find the mini-bar was empty and we could stock up the fridge with refreshments. At over 350.00/night with all the fees/taxes, it was pricey. There was a caf accessible from the hotel and we made a lot of use of it for a quick breakfast before heading out to see the sights. Overall it was really good, but expensive.",

                "text": "Just completed a one night stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We were very happy with everything and can't complain. The staff was professional and courteous. Everyone from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was friendly and always greeted us.Jason checked us in immediately and was extremely nice, efficient, and welcoming. The house keeping staff does a great job in keeping the rooms clean. The decor was modern, the bathrooms beautiful. We were upgraded at no additional charge to a corner suite, maybe because of our Platinum status or maybe because it was a monday. The view was amazing and we loved the electronic blinds and huge room. There is a great shuttle run by Gray Line that takes you to the hotel for 17 dollars round trip, 10.25 one way. We only took the shuttle from the hotel which left at 15 minutes past the hour and 45 minutes past the hour. It was right on time and took less than 45 minutes including two stops at other hotels prior to arriving at the airport. Much cheaper than a 30-40 dollar plus tip cab ride. We have gone to the restaurant Brooklyn on this trip and our last trip also. The entertainment book provides a buy one get one free coupon for it and the food although pricey is worth it. The entertainment book provides many buy one get one free coupons to local attractions including the art museum, Victoria Clipper, aquarium, and others. The hotel is in a good location to attractions and shopping.Pikes market is a straight 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. It is right next door to an awesome movie theatre and the Cheese Cake factory. If you can get a great deal this is a hotel that I would go back to.",

We were on the 27th floor this time and the stay before that, the 28th and the breakfast club had a toasted fire BOTH times! It was very inconvenient to woken up at 7am and have to run down 28 flights of stairs twice. It was a tough weekend due to the purpose of the visit and after a long day and night that was quite a disappointing situation.It would have been nice to be informed that it was taken care of, but we found that out after 20 minutes of waiting outside the hotel for 20-30 minutes each time thinking it was an emergency evacuation",

Exercise room is significantly better than average. I could not talk the front desk into experiencing the concierge lounge for less than 50. Not drinking, I could not justify that cost. Housekeeping was excellent, I requested turn down. I did learn to request sheet changed daily - 3 day sheet changes is too much for me. Bell desk was prompt, friendly. They offered to take my bags up at arrival and I accepted - missed a tip when they forgot about me. Location here is ideal, I walked to everything and cabbed easily in the rain.",

Given Seattle's terrible highway traffic, having a hotel that can be easily reached for a fee of 3.00 on the light rail is a huge plus. The hotel is within easy walking distance of all of the tourist sites, museums, cruise ship and ferry docks, as well as many bars and restaurants. If you are planning on spending all of your time in downtown, you will not need a car if you stay here. If you decide to venture out of the city, there is a Hertz car rental office located in the hotel parking garage. The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The staff is very helpful and eager to make sure that your stay is stress free. If it happens to be raining, be sure to ask the front desk for an umbrella. They provide complementary sturdy and large umbrellas for guest use. We asked for a room with a view of the water. We had a room on the 25th floor that looked straight down Pine street to the famous Public Market sign. The view of Puget Sound was fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel.",

I also thought the cleaning staff did a decent job.What I didn't like: 1) the bathroom has some mildew issues in the shower that needs to be addressed and the tile grout throughout the bathroom needs to be cleaned/bleached as it is showing its wear and lack of cleaning. 2) on the last night of our stay I guess we finally got a next door neighbor and when I tell you the noise from them taking a shower was soooooooo loud... it was borderline unacceptable and really pissed me off. I had to turn the tv up to hear what I was watching. If we had heard that the 1st 2 nights of our stay I would have definitely complained but given it was our last night I left it alone but decided to post this review. 3) view of city was not that great. Our view was mainly of the top of some building and you could see a small part of the water Overall the hotel was ok but what really annoyed me was how loud our neighbors shower was while we were trying to turn in for the night. I don't know that I've ever stayed at a hotel where I could hear my neighbors shower that clearly (and I've stayed at a lot of hotels). This is Completely unacceptable!!!!!",

That was appreciated. So was the quick check in. The rooms are a little tight but the furniture, especially the bed was comfortable. The towels in the bathroom do not know the meaning of soft and that was a bit disappointing. I am highly attuned to smells and the room was overwhelmingly fragrant upon arrival. This is something that I could have done without. As is the ridiculous fee for the wi-fi. In this day age it is insulting when a hotel charges for this service. It feels like they ought to charge to use the alarm clock while they are at it. If it were not for the Internet charge I would give this hotel a 4-star rating.

Room size is comfortable for a hotel in a city, its bathroom is quite spacious. The only thing about this hotel is the reception staff. We were checked in by a stone-faced male staff at the front desk, and checked out by a female staff who was not friendly at all. If I hadn't met other people in the city, I would leave Seatlle with an impression that people there are rude and cold. Thankfully everyone else I met there were friendlier than Grand Hyatt's front desk staff.Seattle has a lot to offer I'm sure I will come back here - but probably not to this hotel.",

The hotel is perfectly clean and very large. We got a suite with a bay view and it was perfect. We even had a view of the famous red Public Market sign! No trouble locating Pike's Place with that view! Room was spotless and bed super comfy. Pillows are little lacking too soft, no support but we still slept really well. Check in was a breeze. When they heard it was our 25th, the gal comped our valet for the entire stay and sent up a bottle pinot grigio! We appreciated her thoughtfulness and enjoyed the wine. Bathroom is luxurious and spotless. Huge shower and separate huge tub were glorious! First time spending a significant amount of time in Seattle and we loved every minute. Thanks Hyatt, we'll be back!",

Only complaint could be that the T.V was very small compared to the standard of the room.Staff were great and always on point.I used the Hyatt Gym everyday and found it to be immaculate and never tooo busy.Only bummer was to pay for internet but at check out the lady asked if I wanted to join up to the Hyatt gold scheme and I did and then the internet was free but unless I had done that the internet was not free which considering the normal rate of the rooms is a little bit much in my opinion. On the subject of cost, I was on a discounted room rate but if I did take the going rate....all I can say is that if you want quality like this....expect to pay for it.Me and my girlfriend enjoyed and were comfortable every minute we were in the hotel.Thank you so much for your review. We're so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. Your comfort and happiness are our main priorities and it's wonderful that the amenities, location and features of the room made your stay a good one.

Two separate rooms always makes life easier on the road, especially for a longer stay.The overall look of the hotel, including our room, was very fresh and pleasant. Very clean as well. We like the fact that many Hyatts now share space with Starbucks--very handy and a nice low-cost option for breakfast.The hotel lived up to our expectations, which were not too high since it is not positioned as a luxury hotel, in most ways. We did find the service a bit off. It seemed as though there were too few staff available to help--long lines at check in and out--but then that may have been a result of staying over a holiday weekend.",

Grand Hyatt and the Sheraton. I had stayed at the Sheraton, which had a nice jacuzzi on top, but wanted to try the Grand Hyatt. We pulled in, had a room readily available, and went to our room. The bathrooms are huge and my wifed loved this. No complaints about the room. The hotel had a nice gym where I was able to workout in the morning with a few of the LA Angels prior to playing the Mariners. Very nice gym with a connecting jacuzzi area. They also had a sauna and a very large and hot! steam room. Connected to the hotel is a really nice Sushi restauant, which if you like sushi, you should check this out as the dishes roll around the restaurant on little conveyer belts. They also had a NY deli style place to grab sandwhiches and a Starbucks. I would stay here. They guys running the valet are very professional as you could tell they know their stuff. The front desk check in was very pleasant. But, one word of caution...nothing to fault of the hotel but more the city of Seattle. My wife and I fell asleep Sunday night around 8pm, thinking we were going to wake up and head out to a restaurant. At 12:15 am, I was out of luck to getting any type of food. Room service closed, so the only thing I could purchase was small little crackers and cookies from the front desk. Not a big deal, but you would think in a city that size you could walk to some place and get a sandwhich. In the morning, I didnt see breakfast, so I think it was all room service. BUT, dont eat there, walk 6 blocks to the Pikes Market and go to Le Panier or Poscky's for pastries. Wonderful Go there early and beat the lines! Eat breakfast at Lowells for crab-dishes.",

All of the downtown attractions are within easy walking distance, as are the train to the airport, light rail to Lake Union, the monorail to the Seattle Center, and buses to pretty much everywhere else. If you're allergic to transit, the hotel will call a cab or car service for you. And if you truly enjoy driving in traffic, there are cheaper places to park nearby. Be sure to ask the concierge for information on discounts to museums and events. If you want to work out, the gym is fabulous, with lots of high-quality cardio and weight equipment. Bring your swimsuit so you can enjoy the sauna, steam room, and whirlpool. And, although as a rule I don't believe in room service, especially in a city with such good local restaurants, the breakfast that we ordered in-room compared favorably to the best food we had anywhere else - good fresh fruit, excellent bread, local cheese, perfectly-cooked eggs delivered hot, top-of-the-line condiments and a not-too-sweet yogurt parfait.

I'm happy to report that these worries were completely unfounded, the hotel is still amazing. There's a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel, as well as a Starbucks and a sushi restaurant. The staff is very helpful. And the location is great for anything in downtown Seattle, either business or pleasure. But my favorite part of the Grand Hyatt Seattle are the rooms. They are modern and I just love the layout of them. As others have reported, the bathrooms are huge, and the whole entry area of the room has stone floors instead of carpet. The views from the upper floors are also amazing, especially on an unusual clear day. I had room service twice and each time it was good and came quickly. Overall, it's a great hotel.

To say that we were pleasantly surprised would, well, cover it....Thank you for your comments. We love that our central downtown location makes it easy for our guests to explore all that our great city has to offer. It's also great that we can offer all you might need without even leaving the hotel. We would love to have you back with us on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager",

There is not cable, they have those antennas that try to find local channels so I spent the entire time watching PBS Kids because it was the only channel the antenna would take in. Doors are very dirty, balcony doors would not lock, furniture is beat up, bed squeaky and would sink so deep I could feel the springs,extra blanket very stinky smell like it was overused and never washed, closet door missing, hairballs in the bathroom, and everything was VERY VERY dusty. SOOO NOT what this place made it to believe it was for the price. It looked like the person who cleaned this place did not care to do their job and it was either never done, or I was given a room that had not been touched in months. Go spend the same elsewhere and get a better experience, or spend less and still get a way better experience.Dear seviemj, thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a feedback of your experience. We are deeply sorry for the inconveniences you experienced, we are checkin all of our apartments to determine which one is the one in discussion as we are already addressing the issue with the housekeeping supervisors to avoid any further issues like this one.",

After several thousand dollars in doctor bills we found that the room was infested with bed bugs. They moved my two employees to another room, which they had to do since they would not refund the payment, but then made them wash all their own cloths several times and made it known that the problem was not theirs but that my employees had brought them in with them. There was no compensation for the trouble or expense and the humiliation was uncalled for. So be prepared that if you stay here, that whatever goes wrong is your fault and nothing of the hotels responsibility and that you should be glad they even let you stay in their marginal hotel. I will make sure none of my employees ever stay there again. Also, tremendous noise and dust from the many construction sites around with no reduction in monthly rate due to the noise.Dear Bud PThank you for choosing us, as Weve told you before, as soon as we were notified about the situation, management were on top of the issue, and we are grateful that our pest control company was notified, checked all your luggage finding that the bed bugs were in your luggage and we were able to content and fix the situation changing you of rooms immediately.

We were staying in SFR for 3 days so wanted to be close to Union Square, which we were. The hotel room we booked was a suite as we travelled with 2 children. The room was fine, clean, modern. Slightly small, but we were in the room very little so it wasnt a priority for us.The staff at the hotel are friendly and very helpful. Ruben will get anything done for you and always with a smile. It does make the difference to be greeted by name and have happy and helpful hotel staff around you.The hotel has a restaurante and bar attached to it... Open to the public and with a good italian/american menu and an excellent atmosphere.There are 3 things that are worth mentioning I think:1. The hotel only has 5 floors so you will hear plenty of street noise etc.2. The windows are small and the aircon/fan units are noisy. Although we didnt really need them very much.3. There is no breakfast available during the week, but there is room service available from 11am onwards. (there are great breakfast places very close to the hotel - Masons was excellent)",

The location is absolutely perfect. You walk right outside and are staring at City Hall on Broad Street. If it wasnt so stinking cold it would have been an ideal location for walkability. Rooms were as expected for Aloft, and value was great as usual. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return when it isnt so cold outside. Hi Micah, 5 STARS! Wow, thank you! Glad you enjoyed our hotel and of course the perfect location. The weather gods were a little off in their timing for your visit. We are looking at record highs this week, want to come back We've got some space available!Looking forward to your enjoying our backyard on the next visit. Sending warm thoughts...Evan",

                "text": "The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan",

The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!",

It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended.

The location is perfect if you plan to hang around the fisherman's wharf area.The hotel is small, as are the rooms, however it has that cosy feel to it. The rooms are cleaner daily and there is an almost constant supply of tea, coffee (plus flavourings and toppings), muffins and sweets, which make for great pre-breakfast or post-dinner snacks.The reception staff were great with us and were on hand to offer help and advice when we needed it. Our only complaint is that due to the size and proximity of the rooms, noise resonates easily. This is not a good thing when the cleaning staff flood the corridors in the morning and talk at an inconsiderate volume. The hotel acknowledges this and provide ear buds next to the beds. I would return here, but will know better than to expect a lie-in in future Thank you for your recent review. We are glad that you found our location, staff and free beverages all day to be a plus for our hotel.Our cozy rooms maintain the same size as when the hotel was built back in 1906. We try to keep the original layout and feel of a historic Inn.Our housekeeping staff has been spoken to and we addressed a memo to them regarding the noise you experienced. Loud conversations by the housekeeping staff in the hallways, especially in the morning, should not be happening anywhere in the hotel. It is with such guest feedback we can make positive changes to the hotel and we really appreciate your honest and positive feedback. We hope to welcome you back soon at the San Remo Hotel.",

In reality, it is way over-priced and of very poor quality: small, very noisy rooms cheap, broken furniture terrible TV reception erratic water temperature in the shower. Only positives were good check in and check out.I stayed in room 620, facing Geary Street, on 6th of 7 floors. The traffic noise was absolutely horrendous and deafening. Also, there was a door to an adjoining room that looked of normal thickness but must be hollow as I could hear every word that the people in the next room said or watched on TV. Also, whenever the HVAC unit came on I had to adjust the TV volume, probably more due to the smallness of the room than anything else. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the hotel provides you with ear plugs along with your shampoo, etc. You will not be able to sleep without the ear plugs.The bathroom is slightly bigger than a closet, with no room or shelves to put your stuff. I took a shower at 5am and the water temperature constantly fluctuated between hot and cold.The furniture is uncomfortable and cheap- the chair for the desk was broken and is not suitable for working.The TV reception is awful - very grainy and only analog. No digital. You do get free wi-fi. Wow.Stay away from this place. I went there via the secret hotel option on Travelocity - the hotel calls itself 3 1/2 stars. It's far from that.Dear Patrick H,Thank you for sharing your comments with Trip Advisor. Please accept my sincere apology for the inconvenience you experienced during your recent stay with us. I always encourage my guests to communicate to myself and my staff any concerns they may have during their stay. This way, we are able to accommodate our guests the best way possible and that they will have a pleasant stay with us. I most certainly hope you will give Hotel Diva another chance and give us the opportunity to change your impression on us. Pleasse contact me directly for future reservations so we can very well accommodate you.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Diva",

I think this place has a bit of arrogance in the way their run their business, though. When we arrived to move into our room with bay views, we got shoveled in a dirty, smelly room in the far upper corners of a building facing a park. I called the office and asked why we were paying for a bay view and got this room. We had to haul our luggage back down to the parkade and drive all the way back to the office to talk to them. They seemed quite upset that we were questioning the room we got they tried again with a room directly across from the stairwell facing a wall, but we refused that room as well. Their third try was this is the last room we have, which we took. It did face the bay, but was a corner room with the stairwell right in front of the door, which made it a little noisy when people's children were running up and down the stairs and breezeways. It was quite a big larger than the first room they tried to put us in, though. When I asked why we didn't get the room we had booked months in advance, the response was we're full. Huh Stay was OK because we didn't have to engage with the staff again until we checked out. Lots of steps and climbs up and down the road if you're in the upper buildings. Restaurant staff on the arrogant side as well. Must be catchy at this hotel! Parking is horrible - don't bring anything bigger than a Ford Fiesta! Wouldn't stay here again. Sadly, they have a great location, but really indifferent, slightly arrogant, almost rude staff. I'd head for Coronado next time!",

All motels in Sunnyvale are expensive compared to similar places elsewhere so we have to factor that in to the price. I have stayed twice recently. All the rooms are not equal. The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable. The immediate location is not great in terms of walking (there is only a Denny's next door), but its 5 minutes from downtown if you have a car.",

If I reviewed this prior, I had tried to be positive but due to the lack of follow up by the management at this location, Corporate after sending a certified letter and supposedly a Regional Manager that was to contact me I no longer care to be nice about our trip. The truth: I totally agree with anyone that says: ROACHES, ROACHES, ROACHES, ROACHES,ROACHES,ROACHES,ROACHES,ROACHES EVERYWHERE !!! In the kitchen(stove,frig), in the toilet, tub, sink, coming out of electrical outlets ! The critters have been there and although they sprayed (twice) it must be so infested throughout the place as obviously the problem still exists into 2015. This location caters to long-term live-ins rather than the vacationing or transit clientele. Our entire bill should have been refunded instead of a token portion. We were offered another room which we turned down not knowing what else we might run into. My husband I will never stay at this location again--we're done.Hi, Laura. We're sorry to hear that you, too, had some insect issues. We are an extended stay hotel and we do have guests who stay for long periods of time and that prepare food in their rooms but that is not an excuse for why this may have happened. We will continue to monitor for and treat any bugs we find and we appreciate you sharing with us that you had an issue.",
