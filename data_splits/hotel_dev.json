The gym is also well-equipped with high quality treadmills and exercise bikes and a universal machine. There are no free weights but there is free bottled water and towels.The breakfast buffet was good but may not be included if you book through a third party site. The hotel is built on a hillside and some of the upper level rooms require some stair climbing. If you wish to avoid that, be sure to ask for a lower level room. Parking is somewhat limited. There is a covered lot that charges a fee for overnight parking or you can choose to park in the free lot on the corner. There are perhaps 20 to 25 spaces in the free lot so plan accordingly.Greetings, and thank you for the excellent, and humorous review! Im pleased to read you found our rooms well appointed and amenities ample. The breakfast buffet at the Old Town Tequila Factory will always get your day started out right!

We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply.",

There is a restaurant on-site which can be accessed within the hotel which is nice as you don't have to go outside (it rained for a couple hours - LOL). I would recommend a modification to the menu to offer more selections. I had the calamari which was okay (I've had better and the potato skins (I've had better) but they both satisfied my hunger so all good on that end. Upon check-out final bill was ready and shuttle was on time. i did forget to tip the driver which I didn't think about initially as i was focused on getting my bags checked in so this CA lady do apologize for that.",

                "text": "When I called into the customer service number to initially make my reservation for my stay, I was quoted a price of 134USD plus taxes. I repeatedly asked the customer service rep the price and he repeatedly answered 134USD plus tax. However, when I arrived at the hotel two days later I was charged 149USD plus tax. I have called customer service 4 times to explain my situation and to get an understanding of why I was overcharged at the hotel, however, I am to this day unable to find a manager at the call center to solve my discrepancy. I explained my situation at the hotel yet they refused to listen and explained that I would have to call customer service. On top of all this, I asked if I would be able to do a late checkout at 2 pm and the front desk attendant responded that I would have to be charged an extra 25 dollars. I was given a king suite and it had a shared door with another room. There was noise coming from the next room though out the night, and it was as if the other people were in the same room as me.My experience definitely did not live up to the Hilton standards that I once knew. Nor my standards for that matter.Hi Roving,Thank you for sharing your experience, I have revised your reservation and it appears that it was booked as a breakfast package. In this case, the rate goes up by every occupant in the room and it appears it was changed from one guest to two guests. I due apologize that we did not exceeded your expectations during your stay, if there is anything else I can do for you please don't hesitate to call (858) 278 9300 ext 0Thank you for staying with us and we hope we can serve you in the future.Happy Holidays!",

The outdoor car park was nearly full, but we were lucky and found a parking spot in the basement floor of the building with a short walk to the elevator.Sammy, lovely lady, checked us in very cheerfully and efficiently into our top floor room at one end of the building. She told us our rooms were renovated in July.The room was very upmarket, spacious, clean with a good sofa bed. The room has all the usual HGI equipment and amenities. The bathroom was clean and bright with an excellent glass shower cubicle. Everything worked well.We had a very good sleep. We had breakfast at 6am before heading out to our early meeting. The restaurant was empty, service and attention by Anai was terrific. The buffet breakfast was very, very good with a good selection of fresh fruits and the cook to order hot food. We decided to stay an extra night, once we worked out that by the time we finished our meetings on the that day, traffic could be heavy heading back to LA in the afternoon. A very helpful Ruben added the extra night stay for us in the same room.The location of the hotel is also very good with restaurants within walking distance, a Walmart, Fry's, etc., just up the road. And more restaurants along Balboa Avenue about a mile away. Traffic did get very heavy in the area, particularly along Interstate 15 during peak hours to get to the hotel.We love our stay.Dear H L, Thank you for your great comments and feedback!

When I was there they had the parking garage closed for steam cleaning and striping. Had to walk in from very dark side streets each night...not a safe situation. They wanted to still charge for parking each night even when we parked off site.

Overall a disappointing experience. I didmt like the fact that it wasn't possible to open the windows in the room.englishmaninmidtown - It is unfortunate to read you did not enjoy your recent experience at the Westin San Diego. The hotel completed a 15 million renovation in 2014 which included our public areas, meeting space and guestrooms. We are a high rise building in a large downtown city, therefore our building windows do not open. There is an air vent at the window to allow for outside air but the windows unfortunately do not open. This feature assists with noise control as well providing our guests with a heavenly nights rest.I hope you will continue to look to Westin's when traveling as I truly believe our brand and its offerings are the best in the industry.

Staff (other than the heavyset girl at the coffee bar) was phenomenal, and very accommodating. As for the coffee bar girl, she was quite friendly with the men in front of me, but gave me attitude because I asked for a sesame seed bagel. Her response (quite haughtily) was, Those AREN'T sesame seed bagels, we ONLY have everything bagels. I asked for the bagel toasted. It was not very busy, and she began to busy herself with the tip jar. I noticed that my bagel had popped out of the toaster and she did not move to retrieve it. I mentioned that the bagel was ready, and she gave me this LOOK, like, I'm busy, OK She put down the tip jar and handed me my bagel. Later that same afternoon, I walked past the area and she once again gave me the same haughty look. Also, 40 a day for valet parking! Luckily, we were able to find parking next door for 20 a day (which happened to be where the hotel valet parked your car!). Of note, the valet told us that the 20 rate required parking after 12:00 noon, and moving the car out before 12:00 noon the next day. Once again, good service/tip. Moving the car was no problem, as we took a drive to Coronado in the morning, and returned in the late afternoon. In room, a complimentary 16 oz. bottle of water every day if you have housekeeping. Otherwise, everything else is a charge. Only one free movie channel, all other movies are pay per view. Gaslamp area is at least 5-6 blocks away. Some areas seemed more safe to walk through than others to get there. Suggest State Street to G Street, then take G all the way to 5th (Gaslamp area). The walk to the embarcadero not bad. Just plan on doing a lot of walking. However, the trolley stop is just a block away, so easy to get to other places like the zoo and Old Town! We could hear the trolley at night, which my husband thought was cool, as he thought it sounded like thunder. All in all, it was a good stay.greysquirrelGirl - Thank you for the detailed review.

My husband, daughter (6), and I were happy with the hotel, especially considering we booked on Priceline, naming our price if only 160.00 per night. This caliber of a hotel on Labor Day weekend would have cost twice that without priceline.Priceline did have us set up in a king room, but at checkin the staff was very courteous and accommodating and moved is into the largest available double room on the 7th floor. The luggage service was great, getting all of our bags to our room within 5 minutes of our arrival and also sharing perspective on local beaches that my daughter may enjoy. The room was very large (considering location) and extremely clean. We enjoyed the location and easily took a few walks to local attractions. We walked to Seaport village, Pier B to see the sand castle competition, the mall, the heart of gas lamp quarter twice or 3 times to eat and little Italy twice. Self parking across the street had a 35 dollars per day rate. We also drove to local beaches (mission, pacific, coronado) and the zoo easily getting pretty much everywhere in 25 min or less. We visited the pool one afternoon which was small but very clean with a perfect water temp and adequate for the number of folks using it. Overall the hotel was a great place to stay, extremely affordable, clean and has a wonderful location! Konrinna D,I am pleased you had a wonderful stay with us in San Diego! Here at Westin, we always do our best to accommodate your needs. Whether it is getting you in the right room to service, we strive to exceed all your expectations.

The conference room was good. Adequate A/V and the food the hotel prepared for the meetings were breakfast, lunch and snacks during the days I was there. All were quite good and well prepared. Give the chef a raise. If youre having or hosting a meeting or traveling on business this is a good hotel to stay. Its a quick ride to the airport and they offer a free shuttle. This location was fine for me. I like to walk but the hotel really isnt that close to anything. Surrounding restaurants were kind of scant. Mostly lunch joints. Youre close to the courthouse and government buildings here. The scenery around you isnt good. I felt the walk outside the hotel seemed a bit sketchy - especially after dark. Exiting the hotel right on Broadway takes you to the waterfront attraction. Lots of homeless, druggies and weirdos down along the waterfront that can be off putting. Its not too far from the hotel but not that close to the hotel, either. Exit the hotel to the left and you can walk to the gas lamp area. Its definitely a hike. Id suggest not walking to the gas lamp all the way on Broadway as the neighborhood down that way gets kind of gritty with a lot of homeless and panhandlers. If you walk to the gas lamp area from the hotel head down Broadway and go down 4th and then cut over to the gas lamp area. This 4th Street seemed to be a safer to me. Overall, this hotel was good. Some things fell a little short such as the pool area. It was a super small skinny lap pool. The deck area near it was a nice place to get some late day sun but they dont do the deck area any justice. Its uneventful. No bar area and nothing to speak of happening there. Just some couches and lounge chairs. The hotel should play this area up more. The hotel bar area was okay but most people are in and out at this place. No real reason to hang around. A lot of the local restaurants have good and affordable happy hour food and drink specials so be sure to get out, walk and explore. If youre a baseball fan do stop and see a Padres game. The stadium is a great experience. Finally, this is a good place to stay when traveling for business.Thank you for staying at the Westin San Diego. We are in an amazing location and offer great amenities that include a number of amenities such as: round trip airport transportation, internet, bottle water in all guestrooms, snack hour daily, local and domestic long distance phone calls, 24/7 Texting service, * Newly added 10 off Spa services, bike rental up to 4 hours, and ticket for the Midway.

Not disappointed. Ocean views from 19 floor room, comfortable Westin beds, and nice lobby bar. 15 minute walk to Petco Park and easily found street parking within 1 block of hotel each evening, which was surprising for the downtown location. Will stay again when in town. Pool and fitness center were a bit disappointing from Westin standards. Complimentary Wi-fi for SPG members, otherwise paid.hvlewfamily - I am pleased to read you found our location to be convenient to all the festivities for the All Star Baseball events. It is unfortunate to hear you didn't enjoy our outdoor pool, Jacuzzi and sun deck. This area is open from 6am to 10pm daily with views of downtown and the bay. Our WestinWORKOUT Fitness Studio is open 24 hours a day and recently we added several new pieces of equipment (bikes, leg machines and an ab machine).

Had a twin room in the Westin which was absolutely perfect - very clean, spacious and really comfy beds. Ideal spot near the Airport and walking distance to Little Italy, Gaslamp Quarter and the waterfront.We had breakfast included but what we weren't told until we questioned it, is the room has a maximum allowance of 45 for breakfast. As the buffet is 24.95 plus tax each, you will have to dip into your pocket AGAIN...sneaky...!!Also, our flight wasn't until 2045, so we put our bags in storage early and headed out for the day. When we got back at 1800, we asked if possible to have a shower and change before our 11hr flight home, to which we were advised we couldn't as no changing facility and just have to use the restrooms. I did ask about the spa facilities but again advised no showering facility at all.Very disappointing for a hotel of this stature. Would I stay here again, probably not for the reasons stated, but IS a very nice hotel and the location is excellent.chsparra - It is unfortunate to read your review and apologize your experience was less than expected, primarily focused around the breakfast allowance and shower facilities. Our breakfast buffet offers more than 30 options and several made to order items, allowing you to custom create to your liking. If you become an SPG member you would also receive a 15 discount off breakfast as well. Due to the various types of packages available that include breakfast we are unable to price match all the package prices for breakfast and try to find a fair and close option. We have considered adding a hospitality room to a future hotel upgrade to help us stand out from the other downtown hotels, however at this time, that is not an amenity we offer. I'm sorry this was a disatisfier and I hope that you will still consider Westin as a brand for future stays. Be Well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager",

We got a room with a great view of the city and bay. The room was very clean with great air con, comfy bed, and hot shower. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't because of the wifi. It's free, but it was useless. Could not stay connected and when I could it was awfully slow.

Back to the original setting and eventually enjoy the shower.Sorry guys, at 490 a night that's not okay.

                "text": "We had our second stay at the St Regis San Francisco for our annual December SF dining weekend--our first was in 2014, though I've had a few business stays in the meantime. Overall, we still love this hotel--but we did experience a few hiccups with service that gave us pause. The hotel has already provided us with a complimentary stay for 2016 to make up for the problems this year, so we feel the hotel got the message and definitely has taken steps to make it up to us.We were informed of our upgrade from the Astor to Metropolitan Suite in an email from my Ambassador the night before arrival. Yet on arrival, they didn't have us in the Metropolitan Suite. After 25 min and showing the email confirmation, we finally were given the keys to the correct suite. This was a big hiccup, but since we got the upgrade I was willing to let it go.The suite and design of the hotel and and everything about it is still near-perfect for me. I love the design of the property, and the layout of the suites/rooms. I love its location in SoMa. I love the food/beverage, from the restaurant, room service and the lobby bar. Everyone is very friendly.We did have several housekeeping mistakes, and the management response to those was less than satisfactory. Even after our complaints, housekeeping still managed to screw up, something that I'd not experienced on any previous stay at this hotel. The fact that this was the weekend immediately prior to the Christmas holiday made me wonder if the property might be a bit understaffed or under-managed. We also had issues with wifi, both in the room (which was fixed in a few hours) and in the restaurant (which was fixed in about 20 min). We finally had issues with trying to reach our butler(s) on several occasions. We would call and it would ring and ring and ring with no answer on numerous tries. That was also another first for us at this hotel. We often had to call another department to be connected to the butler or front desk, and even then it took more time than it should have. That again made us wonder if the hotel was understaffed due to the imminent holiday period.Otherwise, again, we still love this hotel. Considering that we've had nothing but near-flawless visits here, we were and are most willing to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The fact that the hotel management awarded us a free 3 night stay for next December 2016 to remedy the mistakes of this visit more than made up for us for the lack of excellent service in the instances described above. We have faith that these were unusual slip-ups, and I still look forward to returning. I also have several business trips to SF planned in 2016, and I expect to be staying here for those, as well.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I regret hear of the delays in service that you received during this visit, and sincerely appreciate your understanding and loyalty to our hotel. We look forward to welcoming you back on several occasions in 2016, but please do not hesitate to contact me directly at any time.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com",

Three nights again in a beautiful and spacious Metropolitan Suite with proper blackout shades installed in 2016 per my request. Air con was great as always. Had our dog with us again, too.Service and food/beverage again were fabulous. Spectacular Platinum recognition, as always, due both to my Ambassador level status and the fact that I stay here many times every year. (I'll be back again in late August.)The only misses were:(1) Concierge had sloppy mistakes confusing our party sizes for bookings at 2* Commis and 3* Saison. Created a bit of confusion and a little exasperation when arriving at Saison and booking was under wrong name. Settled but stupid.(2) Twice had calls to butler ring way too long before anyone picked up. Pet peeve of mine.(3) Room service didnt have pork sandwich as per menu for a lunch order, then brought my chicken sandwich ordered without avocado...but with avocado--and not toasted fully. Stupid and not impressive. Replaced quickly and whole lunch order was compd.Obviously, the service recovery was wonderful in each instance. But those are mistakes that this hotel doesn't usually make.Still, we had a truly fabulous stay with amazing service otherwise. Everyone knows us by name. Butler service was fab. Packing and unpacking were great. Pressing and shoe shine were done with aplomb. Great service at the amazing bar, at the restaurant for breakfast, from the front desk, valets, everyone.This still is my favorite hotel by far in SF. And it now ties with the StR NY as my 2 favorites in the whole of the USA.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. We were delighted to welcome you back to the Best Address, and sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our associates and service.

Great earth tone colors and tasteful art through out the building. Food: They have a lobby lounge which is great for just hanging out, having a meeting, or wanting to have a little snack. Nice atmosphere not too quiet, not too loud. They have Art of Tea which is served daily between 2-4pm and reservation are recommended, and finally their restaurant the Grill which is a contemporary dining. Beautiful dishes, great tastes and really if you just want a nice dinner without leaving the hotel you really can't go wrong, but again you are in San Francisco.. Rooms: Well the rooms as I said are amazing. Very clean, very contemporary but comfortable. huge windows allow you to see amazing views of the city and parks. Everything is automated, the bathrooms are large and comfortable. If you like the finer things in life, or want to take your partner on a romantic night this is it.

I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival, which was the same afternoon of the wedding.I called at 2:00pm that afternoon, an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room, took down my cell phone number, and would call me when it was ready.We arrived around 2:30pm, stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready. OK, we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away, and away, and away! My wife went back and asked for our room because we had to get prepared for the wedding! While the desk personnel were apologetic, they tried to offer a handicap accessible room, which we did not want. Then they tried to blame the situation on the fact that we had booked a king room on the reservation block for which they had already written and confirmed we reserved. The clock is ticking past 4:30pm ... and finally we get our room keys!We hurry outside to where our bags have been sitting on a luggage cart, tell the attendant that we have our room and need our bags immediately to prepare for the wedding, now about 1 hour away! We thought our bags would arrive on the heels of our entering the room, but NO ... again waiting ... so we started to prep the younger girls ... still no bags!My sixteen year old daughter went back down stairs and found our bags had not moved! She was livid ... and finally got them to start moving the cart. It was 5:15pm by the time our bags came. I understand that porter was just doing his job, when he asked if he could set up our bags in any particular place or if we needed ice, or how to operate the room controls ... but at that moment our immediate needs were for him to get the bags in the room as fast as possible and to leave so we can dress for the wedding! We all rapidly threw ourselves together ... my wife having triple duty ... in order to arrive a few floors down for the wedding.The entire experience of checking in was horrendous. From the call to confirm at 2:00 pm until we got our room and finally our bags! Not one of the hotel staff exhibited any sense of urgency for our situation. To appease us, they offered and we accepted to park our car onsite for a free night.On an afternoon full of anticipation for seeing family and friends at the wedding and reception (also at the St. Regis) ... we went through a tremendous amount of stress from that check-in experience. We're seasoned travelers so we can and have handled the ups and downs of travel ... in this case, I had to double my normal 24 hour rule for posting a negative review, because I'm still fuming. A five star hotel such as the St. Regis should never have their guests wait 2 hours past their own published check-in time to access their room.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize on behalf of our entire staff for the extended delay upon arrival to your room and the multiple inconveniences that were caused to you and your family. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may further discuss the details of your stay, and how we may improve this unfortunate experience.

I want to be treated well, I want staff to acknowledge my presence, and I want them to be courteous and kind and helpful and most importantly quick.In a consumers' world, we have to pay attention to detail. Otherwise the providers will become lazy..At the St. Regis, attention to detail is not a problem. To say the least, they go overboard.All the rooms are cleaned to perfection before arrival, I've stayed here a total of 6 times and have never found something from the room beforeRoom service is of 4-5 Star quality food, hot and ready and fresh.Do not tip the room service, the gratuity is already factored in. Unless you feel like splurging.Amazingly well done eentree choices ordered directly to your room..The reason I go to hotels, is to escape life, go to the spa, sit in my room, watch movies, and be waited on.This hotel does it all.For a Price.a 3 day ultimate vacation as I like to call it, room service once a day, and the spa once a day,Can easily run you over 2000-3000 Dollars here.If you want to just enjoy the room and resort, you can get away with spending 900-1200 on a room for 3 nights and just enjoying yourself.My first stay here was with a Mercedes Benz Voucher way back in the day.Thanks Mercedes Benz, you introduced me to a fantastic resort!Dear Patrick B,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of The St. Regis San Francisco.

I would highly recommned making reservations at Gary Danko for dinner, one of the best meals I've ever had! Also Boulevard and Postrio were fantastic and R G Lounge has amazing, authentic chinesse food. I also loved Taylor's Refresher along the Embarcadero for fun and delicious diner style food in an open, casual atmosphere.Overall, the St. Regis is the place to stay if you are looking for one of the best hotels in San Fran with luxury, privacy, and amazing service.",

Hotel is about 5 minute walk from the Montgomery Street station. Arrived at Noon - room was not yet ready. Front Desk attendant took my phone number and said they would call when room become available - but they never called. Not a big problem - I went out and enjoyed the sights. Came back around 3:30 and was then able to check-into my room. Was given a north-facing room on the top floor (top floor of hotel, that is - the upper floors of the building are for the St. Regis Residences). Room decor was very serene and calming. Never heard anything from outside or other quests while I was here! Bathroom was especially nice, with lots of room, wonderful amenities, rainforest shower and separate soaking tub. Everything in the room seemed fine, except for my master-control panel - some of the features just wouldn't work (phone, radio control, etc.) - I never called for assistance, just got by with using the other phone (think there were four phones total in the room). Bed and linens were OMG spectacular. Slept like a baby and felt wonderful when I woke up!Took any early morning swim in the pool - very nice - and it was great that the pool is open 24/7. Fitness center was well-equipped, and super clean.Ate Breakfast at the hotel restaurant - which was lovely, but quite expensive. Lobby bar and main restaurant looked lovely, but I didn't have a chance to experience them. Visited the Museum of African Diaspora which is accessible from first floor of the hotel - very nice place. The hotel has a great location for visiting the fine arts museums - many within a block or two - Yerba Beuna Gardens, Jewish Heritage, Museum of Modern Art. Also just a couple blocks from the high-end shopping of Union Square.If you are seeking a space of serene luxury in the heart of the SF hustle and bustle, the St Regis definitely delivers.",

(How did we ever travel before Trip Advisor) Loved our time here. We requested and were given a quiet room - on the 17th floor. Everything about the St. Regis is stylish and modern (though not as great as the St. Regis in Manhattan). I loved the TV in the bathroom. Minor annoyances - the tv remote didn't work - probably dead batteries there was no price list for the overpriced wine in the wet bar - it took 20 minutes to have one sent up the electronic control center on the nightstand acted up a few times, turning the lights on in the middle of the night and I find it annoying to be charged extra for the wi-fi use (15/day). Regarding a couple comments posted earlier about the hallway carpeting, I loved it - a really fun design element. (will post a photo of it) We had the best meal of our stay in the hotel restaurant. The lap pool was warm and beautiful and empty - unfortunately I forgot my suit. Too bad the spa didn't have a basic suit to sell, like they do in some hotels. I would happily stay here again. By the way, San Francisco,what's up with the homeless people on your streets I've never seen so much panhandling and yelling and screaming and craziness and was actually afraid in some situations.",

The room was so tranquil with neutral colors and simple yet elegant and comfortable furnishings. The bathroom is well appointed with a large vanity area and a deep soaking tub which fills quickly. It is open to the bedroom but with a panel that can be closed for privacy. The bed is so comfortable with the softest sheets. The staff is friendly and helpful. Having checked in somewhat late and being a Starwood member (which was acknowledged at check-in) a request for a (brief) late checkout was honored without any problem. I have found that in general bring polite and reasonable helps a great deal with requests like these. My rate included breakfast which was fresh and plentiful. The service at Vitrine was friendly and quick. I was not there long enough to try the spa, pool or fitness facilities but the look great and I hope to go back for a longer stay and try them. My only complaint about the hotel is the cost to park. The valets are quick and friendly but that doesn't entirely justify over 50 to park for overnight. Also, and this is just a general gripe, I encountered a few spoiled and rude fellow guests who seemed to think that paying a premium for a hotel room entitles them to slam doors and be generally disruptive in public areas. It's just a general wish that people would be polite and act appropriately. I won't blather on about staying on some of the world's best hotels, blah, blah, blah. However the St. Regis San Francisco in my opinion ranks with those in terms of location, service, amenities and comfort.",

Close enough to the Moscone center (5 minute walk) Staff were very nice and remembered our names, (somewhat) Very nice rooms and comfortable beds. They would clean your room after you left and turn down the beds right before you got back. Unfortunately sometimes the timing was a little off and they walked in while I was changing once and came in while we were there a few other times. It didnt bother me a whole lot but just be aware that if you don't want them to come in then put out the 'do not disturb' sign. Mandatory valet parking and sometimes we were waiting for that service. overpriced hotel bar, you might almost laugh at the prices unless you are made of money (I am not) but then again with how much it costs to stay there a night you probably wouldn't even wink. my view was of a construction sight but I wasn't in the room much so no matter. Never went to the restaurant. there is a pool on the 5th or something like that floor but we didn't swim. Would definitely reccomend if you are rich.

                "text": "We had a long layover in San Francisco and chose to stay in Union Square. The St Regis met our needs in terms of a comfortable place to stay, from which to explore some of the touristy areas of SF. However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out. Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags. We don't generally enjoy the butler concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18. There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back. Food was extremely pricey. The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults. We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver something for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment. It is definitely geared toward the business traveler.Dear Globaltattler,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your most recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We apologize that you experienced increased traffic over the Pride weekend, and that our Butler service did not meet your expectations. Here at the St. Regis San Francisco we truly strive to surprise and delight all of our guests, and we are always grateful for any feedback that will allow us to do that better.Please do reach out to me personally should your travels bring you back to San Francisco.Warm Regards,Andre BroseHotel Manager",

We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg, as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street, while not of the same caliber, has infinitely better views. So, ask for floors 14-20. Below that, it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now, for the good stuff: Nice pool area, very good spa treatments, and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic, with SF Moma half a block away, and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall, a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel, but definitely the best in San Francisco.",

Opt for the butler service -- always spot on and an amazing asset during your stay, from wake up service to the little touches, they anticipate your needs - the butler service is one of the hallmarks of the St. Regis experience. Gin and tonic Why yes, please.I stay at the St. Regis when I have friends in from out of town or when I just need a few days of aaaahhh time or when I'm returning from a long haul flight.

After researching and considering many hotels, I chose the St. Regis. I was very happy with my choice. The location was great - it was close enough to every place we wanted to visit, without being in the middle of too much of the touristy crowd. Although our room didn't have the floor to ceiling windows I was expecting, it was nicely equipped and well maintained. I can overlook my disappointment over the absence of a panoramic view because of the amazing service. From the time we made our reservations to the time we left the hotel, the service was attentive and thoughtful, without being obtrusive. The concierge and guest relations people helped us with our wine tour, ferry and restaurant plans. The people at the front desk and in the lobby greeted us by name. Those at the restaurant, the Vitrine, were particularly kind and thoughtful. Kane was our server on most mornings. When he found out it was my birthday, he brought me a special breakfast dessert. To celebrate our anniversary, he brought us champagne and chocolate. The service made it truly a memorable stay. I'm sure that the service at the St. Regis will become the standard by which we will measure other hotels.Dear Kingtrips,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

Location is perfect, just South of Market, right next to the Museum of Modern Art, across the street from Yerba Buena, Metreon, and a short walk to all of the Union Square and Market Street shopping. The hotel is modern and sophisticated, but also really comfortable and welcoming. We loved the fireplace that greets you on the other side of the front door, and the lobby bar is super chic with a lively scene. We loved the indoor pool! This is a great amenity for a city hotel, especially when traveling with a family. The pool is warm and there are tons of windows and natural light. There's a poolside menu for food and beverages. Grill is the contemporary restaurant that serves seasonal dishes with locally sourced ingredients. We are gluten free and they do a fantastic job with this - lots of gluten free menu options and the gluten free bread was delicious. We saw the beautiful house car (a Bentley), but our timing was off with it pulling away each time we were hoping to catch a ride (next time!). We were in a Grand Deluxe Guest room on the 20th floor, and it was amazing. Beautifully finished with high ceilings, big windows allowing for lots of natural light, plenty of space, huge shower, soaking tub, and amazing views over Yerba Buena. My son said the roll away was one of the best he has ever slept in. Can't wait to return to this hotel.",

The service is helpful and the hotel has valet parking. The guys that park your car are very friendly and helpful with directions and general information. It is a beautiful hotel, but it is not luxurious! Don't expect the 4 Seasons! My tip is to buy a package including breakfast and car parking. Although the price goes up, there is no unpleasant surprises at check out and you can order whatever you want for breakfast without worrying about the cost. The hotel is a lovely location for weddings and there are always several taking place on the weekends. Thank you so much for the review and for staying with us for nearly ten years! It sounds like you enjoyed nearly all of our amenities during your recent trip. We are happy to hear that one of your favorites is the breakfast buffet. Great tip on going with a package!

The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!",

The breakfast was never good, however a little repetitive with no real major choice changes throughout our stay. If they added a few extra items and had different choices for breakfast during the week would put this hotel over the top. However, I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to staying at a Disney (on-site) hotel.",

The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home.",

Decatur Street is prime with its little shops restaurants, river market and coffee caf right across the street and never felt unsafe walking here at night as I did on Royal Street at night. The location is great but the Inn was also fantastic - not because it was upscale fancy rooms but for the overall romantic and historic atmosphere. Add to that the friendly and helpful attitudes of those working there. We had already paid 250 for a 3 night stay on a deal where they would try to sell us other properties - we were to stay at the Wyndam in the French Quarter. Thou we will probably lose our 250 we are still glad we chose French Market Inn and we hope to stay here again in the future.So glad you enjoyed your stay.

There is a shuttle service which we used from the hotel to the airport for a 7:30am departure. Shuttle arrived on-time and driver was super friendly and helpful even at that early hour. We did not use the shuttle from the airport to the hotel. Unfortunately, we did not realise until we had walked over the pedestrian walkway from the airport terminal to the shuttle stop that the courtesy 'phones were back in the terminal. So, after waiting a short while, we decided to just grab a cab - the cabs line up directly across from the shuttle bus stopping area. Check-in was friendly and efficient and even though we had arrived mid morning, the gal was only too pleased to provide us with a room that was ready along with a discount voucher for the restaurant next door and a free breakfast coupon.Reception has lots of seating available and there is a computer with printer available for free use either to do your airport check-in or surf the web.Room was lovely. Chest of drawers, tv, coffee maker, fridge and microwave, a couple of chairs and office desk and very comfortable bed. Loved the q-tips and cotton buds in the bathroom along with other standard items.Service by everyone was wonderful. Super friendly staff, room attendants and maintenance guys too. The free-Wifi connection was excellent both in the room, on it's balcony and down by the pool.The pool, though small was very clean, lots of towels were available and has chairs, umbrellas, loungers and tables as well as a soda and beer/wine dispenser.As mentioned, the location is perfect. It is easy to walk to the waterfront and there are plenty of shops, restaurants bars and cafes etc. in and around the hotel. The attached restaurant where the free breakfast (we didn't take the breakfast on this occasion) is served, provides excellent service a menu with lots of choices and the food was excellent and in very large portions!The wakeup call we had scheduled and the shuttle we arranged for an early morning departure were on-time and checkout was fast and friendly.Definitely would stay here again for a pre/post cruise or airport stopover and it would be okay for a longer stay too.",

The fitness center is very small and does not offer a lot of options. It is an interior room with no windows, which makes you feel like your working out in a basement. The ceilings are also low and I almost hit the light fixtures with the weights a couple of times, and with my head on the elliptical machine. The staff was very nice and friendly, however, they failed to advise me that they would be working on the hot water lines from 7am -7pm, so I ended up taking a cold shower with water pressure that was very low.

Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect.",

Would definitely stay there again for a Baltimore vacation. As you would imagine, this hotel is geared towards airport travelers and executives, and a shuttle runs continuously between the airport and hotel. I would suggest having a shuttle also running to the Inner Harbor, which would broaden the hotel's base of travelers by offering an easy way into the Harbor (and avoiding having to take the Light Rail service).

When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well.",

No pool onsite, but access is given to a nearby gym at reasonable rates apparently. - Small but beautiful elevators- Only hotel that I have been to that has Opus One and Johnny Blue bottles available for purchase in each room. - We had free wi-wi in room- We had Club access and that is our favorite way to go at the Ritz. Some pros and cons include: * Lots of food and coffee when needed * Some flies on cheese * Helpful and nice people / service * Great breakfast * Repeated menu EVERY single day... a bit boring. - Got free parking with one of my rooms, but not the other. Would have been 65/day (!) - Nice amount of pens, paper, soaps, and other useful items in room including currency power converter for international devices- Choice of AM newspapers- Extremely fair at checkout... anything we didn't agree with was immediately taken off our bill. Cons:- Horses hang out across the street and often lobby has horse-smell. - Cigarette smell in EACH of three hotel rooms that I was in during my stay. After about 5 minutes in the room you wont notice it any more. - Very few, if any, rooms with two beds in them... - The employee's two way radios do not work in every room, causing delays- In room safe is too small for laptop- Welcome water was offered by front desk, but could have been helpful in the room instead. - Requested to see if an upgrade was available at checkin -- maybe, but only for additional money. - Do not even think of getting a room not facing central park in this hotel. Not only does it not face central park, it faces NOTHING. We moved out of this smelly room immediately. - Draws are small in room- Only one luggage rack in our room- Relatively small rooms to other Ritz properties I've been to",

Everyone was intent on making our stay the best it could possibly be. A nice touch, on checking in I let slip it was our anniversary when we were handed our complimentary cocktail cards (v nice touch) to welcome us. The extremely personable reception lady (from Czech Republic) must have made a mental note, because on the evening of our anniversary we were sent champagne and chocolates.The Ritz Carlton is a super luxurious hotel but at a human scale and we could find no fault at all during our stay.

The rooms are about 100 square feet larger than most hotels in the city and the We of course are the Only Five Star Hotel on the list of comparisons.

Whilst checking in I didnt feel the usual Ritz welcome service I had experienced in other Ritz Hotels. We made our way up to a very pleasant room with a Cava chilling and selection of chocolates and a birthday card welcome which was a lovely touch to the start of our vacation. Our room was not quite ready as the put up bed had not been set up, our arrival was approximately 8pm so I would have thought this would have been done. We hit the shops ( Black Friday). On returning to the hotel all was done. We continued to enjoy our stay at the Ritz which an amazing setting in an ideal location. The doormen where very attentive as we were in and out and nothing was to much trouble for them.Getting ready to go out on Sunday evening I realised an item of jewellery was missing. Security initially could not do enough and we were given access to Club Lounge as we needed to hang around the hotel more than we wanted to to help with investing the incident. Not ideal when we only had a 5 day stay. However, after 24 hours and the item was never found I felt like we were under suspicion. We never heard anything from Security again. Police took statements. On arrival back to the UK we have had to contact Ritz to find out any outcome of their investigation and are still no further on. Overall staying at Ritz Hotels is amazing experience but this particular stay did not make me feel like a valued customer....",

Initially we were given the wrong room and, despite having been in contact with the customer service manager up front (both regarding the honeymoon and the fact we are platinum members) our special requests were not followed up.But, upon contacting the front desk on these points, the Ritz Carlton staff made every effort in giving us a great stay and provided us with complimentary drinks and dinner.The fact the overall score comes to average is noy only due to the disappointment while checking in, but also due to the fact that the Ritz prices are high. And the overall customer experience you get in return is just not up to par. The rooms are nice, but small and in need for remodelling. As are the hallways and some of the public spaces. Furthermore we would have expected more qualified staff as well. At slightly lower rates we would have given the Ritz a score of 4. But, again, good hotel in a great location. Oh and by the way, the beds are simply devine.Dear Sjors257,Thank you for your feedback and please accept my deepest apology as the image of our hotel was not up to your expectation. I regret that you left with a completely negative impression of our hotel and please know that regaining your trust and faith in our hotel is very important to us.

                "text": "Stayed here for 3 nights recently and first time at this hotel. This is a great location and we were upgraded to a lovely room overlooking Central Park. The location is convenient to shops, restaurants and theaters. Front desk staff are courteous and accomodating as well as the bell and doormen and the rooms are beautufully appointed and spotlessly clean. The Club Lounge was very disappointing, though, from the standpoint of service and amenities. I have been to RC club lounges all over the world so in comparison this one rates at the very bottom. First, the staff seem more inclined to converse with each other than anticipate and serve the customer. For example, they were very slow to clean up tables, replace food items, or bring requested items (that are not out of the ordinary such as expresso, gluten free bread, plain yogurt). No anticipation of the guest's needs-just a total sense of uncaring and complacency. In fact, on my third morning for breakfast, i asked for these items for the third time and was greeted with a reluctant acknowledgement plus I overheard the concierge make a snide remark to the servers. As a female executive traveling often, I have never encountered this in an RC club lounge previously. My gluten free bread arrived with one heal of the bread loaf, quite shameful in a 5 star hotel. Overall, in spite of the lovely location and beautiful rooms, this experience does not compel me to return nor recommend to my business colleagues. There are plenty of other excellent hotels in NYC who will appreciate your business.Thank you for being our guest this weekend and for taking your time to complete a Review of the hotel. I am glad that you found the location and quality of the hotel to be wonderful - but I am sorry that your club experience was not as you expected. I have reviewed your comments with my team.I was pleased to find out that you were given a 300 credit at check out to compensate for the experience. I have reviewed your room bill and do see that the credit has gone through and should be reflected in your American Express Statement.Thank you once again for staying wiht us. Warm Regards,Elizabeth",

The quality of the food is great too. The room was very nice. We were upgraded to a bigger room with a view towards the park. The location of the hotel is great: close to 5th avenue shopping, Central Park and not far from the theater district. The only part that I think needs to be remodeled is the entrance/lobby area. It's a little cramped and dark for a hotel of this quality. They were remodeling the outside though.",

This Ritz Carlton however, provides luxury and immerses you with the local culture. Like what many neighbors of the Ritz Carlton experience, I felt like I was returning to a luxury residence building. You enter effortlessly past bellman that remember you, and into what feels more like a private foyer rather than a lobby. From there you can be up to your room in no-time given elevators that you rarely have to wait on and our rooms proximity to the elevator - which is what I loved given my 35pound dog traveled with me.The Parkview Guestroom we had on the 6th floor was beautifully decorated and had unforgettable views into the park. Since it was winter, we were able to look right into the park - specifically viewing a sanctuary and large pond. The room was also very well laid out, and even with a rollaway bed it felt spacious.A spa treatment at the onsite LaPrairie Spa was very private and relaxing. Auden Bistro the Star Lounge feature classic menus with discrete service. Espressos ordered through Room Service arrived quickly and hot. And the complimentary coffee and tea in the bar was appreciated.The Ritz Carlton certainly extends their service and amenities to pets as well. My dog was treated like a prince! He was given several welcome amenities and genuinely recognized by the staff each time he passed through the lobby.The purpose of this stay was to celebrate my mom's birthday with my parents. They recognized the celebration and provided a unique amenity for my mom - a large silver frame with the Ritz Carlton logo! I even really enjoyed the location, with a great espresso bar around the corner, a very casual Italian restaurant recommended by the concierge, and of course the park.Some staff outshines others, there is a faint sound of street noise from the 6th floor, and there's the smell of horses when in front of the property - but none of this takes away from the hotel's well deserving status of being a Forbes 5 Star AAA 5 Diamond property.

I used the concierge several times, and was able to get into a restaurant that showed up as nothing available on Open Table by using the Ritz' contacts.The club had (alcoholic) drinks available all day , or at least every time we stopped. The bites sized portions served at the pre dinner hour were plentiful and had great variety.Breakfast was nice. Would have been nice to include an egg option,maybe scrambled eggs or something. We had bagels with smoked salmon or oatmeal most mornings. The coffee was good as well.The only thing that was not perfect was that each bed nobly had to flattened out down pillows on it , so we asked for a couple extra which were brought up immediately with a smile.Thank you to the Ritz for a memorable stay !",

Planned a girls shopping trip to NYC 6 months ago and booked Ritz over other considerations. Have stayed at Ritz- Central Park one other time many years ago with family and had a magical experience. So in the efforts to recreate the last experience I booked again. In my opinion the location can not be beat (I am shocked when folks say they don't like mid town, sooooo much to do within feet from hotel). From the second you arrive you are made to feel increadably special, amazing welcoming staff. We splurged and upgraded to club level (highly recommend for many reasons), so we checked in and headed to club level for a much needed cocktail. The Club lounge is beautiful and very welcoming. Equiped with heavy appetizers, wine, champagne, bottled water, etc it was a sight for sore eyes (We had been traveling for 9 hours). Within a minute of arriving, Lazar who was on duty asked if we would like a beverage we said yes 'Martini's please' (can't say enough about how much we enjoyed Lazar, great personality, great martini maker, great representative to the hotel). The room was very lovely, what you would expect of a Ritz. The location of this hotel is right accross the street of central park, blocks from the best shopping anywhere in the world and you can walk to Time Square Theatre district. Sit in the lobby bar and it's people watching galore. Keep eyes pealed you just might see a celeb or two. I had very high expectations (based on last visit) and the Ritz effortlessly topped themselves. Will be back, and worth every penny.",

Great to have a margarita in the restaraunt and look down on Old Town. Weekends can be noisy due to party crowd in Old Town, but week days are quiet.Thank you for leaving impressions of your stay. The Old Town Tequila Factory is our new restaurant and indeed, offers panoramic views of San Diego. Many rooms at the hotel also offer great views. We look forward to your next stay!

                "text": "I live in San Francisco and stayed here for a few nights in July 2013. Internet rates were 130/night, but I was able to get a (smallish) room with private bath for 80+ tax by asking directly through the hotel.Hotels can be pretty expensive in SF, average rate for a decent place is usually close to 200/night. I used to recommend the Elements Hotel to a certain brand of visitor (just need the basics, spend a lot of time out, location is key), but Elements is no more, having been converted to veteran housing. So, Tropica it is now, which is slightly nicer and a little more expensive.My room was clean and modern. At the back of the hotel, with great natural light. Bathroom seems brand new. Comes with mini fridge and microwave. Does not seem to be daily maid service. Free WiFi, which is spotty at the back of the hotel (they also have a dedicated PC for guest use at the check in window).If you like to go out to eat, bar hop, listen to live music, shop for trendy clothes, location here is ideal - it is literally surrounded by restaurants, with some of the most heralded - Locanda, Mission Chinese, Foreign Cinema, Bar Tartine, Range - all within easy walking distance. Too many bars, of all types, to mention - from Mexican bars with mariachis to some of SF's most creative cocktails. And live music within a short walk - the new Chapel, the old Elbo Room, which has had Sunday late night reggae dance parties for over 10 years, and one of my favorites, Amnesia, a quirky little romantic place with excellent, lesser heard music, from Balkan and Gypsy jazz to bluegrass, punk karaoke, folksy singer/songwriters, etc.Hotel is less than 2 blocks from 16th/Mission BART, which goes straight to SFO. Also close to Dolores Park and Castro.Tropica is not for everyone. I give it 3.5 stars overall. But if you want more than a hostel, and can live without full service, and being right in the action is important, this is a very good bargain.",

I am never asked by Marriottt (as a gold) for my ID...but here I was asked, and because I forgot my ID, I ended up paying the last minute rack rate. I was not happy. Often i can get my office to email me something, but as would happen, the person who has a copy of my ID, was not in the office by the time I checked in..... so I am forced to pay out of my pocket the difference.... while the guy checking me in was trying to be nice about it, he insisted on the higher rate (after 30 years, this has NEVER happened, tho' I have been asked for my ID 2 times in 30 years as usually my profile is used). Since I am liable for my badge if I loose it, I don't travel with it. In addition the rate for parking is over 20 per nite (self parking where one has to walk in the snow/ice to park and retrieve their car)...... While I know that they are just enforcing a policy, I am a gold and have an established Marriot profile..... I will try to reduce the charge when I get back home, but I was really unhappy with this treatment.Hotel room was the smallest I have stayed outside many Manhattan hotels (however, even the Marriott Marquis in Times Square is 3 times bigger than this hotel). Attached is a copy of the bathroom photo that shows you have to step around the toilet to close the bathroom door.... unbelievably small. Room was marginally clean, as I found an empty water bottles in the room from the prior occupant, something sticky on the desk, and had to use my white noise machine for to sleep given the person next door who either had a guest or was on the phone talking rather loudly (tho' thin walls happens at many hotels).As you enter hotel, reception desk is on the left and there appears to be a large bar. You have to use a room key in the elevator to go to your floor and any permitted floor. The hallways are decorated with an attempt at stylish. Bed is very comfortable, which is why the three bubble rating.This hotel is about the same distance to the FAA offices on Devon, but next door to one of the airport contractor offices which is why I decided to re-try it...... I come to Chicago monthly, and this is the first time in a very long time I have stayed in this hotel. Normally I am at the Westin in River Road or the ORD Hyatt. Given the difficulty with the rate.... doubt I will be back here and have already booked the Westin for my next stay.Dear Mary V.: I am very sorry that you did not have the proper ID for the preferred room rate you booked and your stay with us did not meet your expectations. We already reviewed your suggestions with the entire team. Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay. Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl",

I don't do well with these things but managed to somehow drown it in the semi hot water the hotel offered. Have to say that that traumatized me a little. Hate spiders, especially big ones. I managed to take a shower after that, always looking around me for more. After I dressed I decided to make a cup of coffee in the room's keurig, poured the creamer that is supplied into the cup. It immediately curdled! When checking the expiration date on the creamer it read 8/11/15 and my stay was on 9/5/15. After that I just packed up and checked out. Receptionist at desk was nice but didn't offer discount for the problems I encountered. Only good thing I can say is the pillows were comfy. Checking this dump off my list.",

My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck.

It's reasonably priced and has full services--coffee bar, restaurant, room service, and pantry with snacks/beverages just off the front desk.But what earned 5 stars from me was the incredible service. Southern hospitality is one thing these folks raise it by an order of magnitude. A few examples: My colleagues and I had access to the club lounge for breakfast, and arrived half an hour before it was over. The urn of coffee was running out--so the concierge ran downstairs and brought us Starbucks. (They also have a self-serve espresso-based drink machine.) There are also a cadre of very nice gentlemen working the door to help with baggage and transportation. One day I walked in and the gentleman with a luggage cart jokingly offered me a ride--staff with a sense of humor! And the day I left, a staff gentleman in the hall saw me with my bag and was genuinely interested in how my stay was (not the kind of rote mumbling question that desk attendants everywhere have to ask). Net net, I felt like all of the team here really cared about me having a great stay. I'll be back.Dear Mary M,It was a pleasure welcoming you to JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead. Thank you for mentioning how much you enjoyed our inspired and tailored hospitality. Our attentive and knowledgeable staff work hard to ensure our guest's expectations are exceeded throughout their stay. Thank you for choosing us for your visit to our beautiful city, and we hope to see you again soon.Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations",

The Comfort Suites not only met our needs, but exceeded them. With outstanding staff at the front desk (Myron and Diana get Gold++ stars) and an outstanding group sales Manager (Josh) our group flew over any bumps. The smaller lobby and (2) elevators still processed our check-in and departure easily. The breakfast was wonderful and breakfast room (and adjoining Community Room) accommodated our 110 people easily. The rooms are very large, with the kitchen and washer/dryer huge plusses. The hotel staff was wonderful enough to unplug 37 stoves (so our students weren't tempted to misbehave). That's the kind of staff we are dealing with. Whether you are traveling on business, or with family, or a large group, this property will make your stay awesome!!! Many thanks again to the Comfort Suites.

Details: the bathroom door didn't fit/hard to close vanity drawers opened into door-jam towels were not replaced consistently and there wasn't dishwashing soap in the kitchen. For the entire week, some channels on tv weren't available (Basic Cable) the lobby computers were down.Staff were always helpful and pleasant but some things were out of their control.The actual toilet/tub room was beyond small. The overall bathroom would be better served if the door was placed on the hallway.For the price and convenience, this was an acceptable place to stay and I would stay there again.Dear JSharp2014,Thank you for your recent review. I am so happy that you enjoyed our team's service and the size of the rooms. I do apologize for the door not closing properly and the replacement of towels and we will look into this and have it corrected. We don't offer dish washing soap in our suites for the reason that our housekeeping team cleans all of the dishes daily. We are in the process of upgrading our entire TV system to offer 72 HD channels which will correct your issues. I do apologize for the business center being down while you were here. The computers are brand new and the provider placed an update on them that allowed them not to work.

I used to live in Chicago so I know the city really well and know this location is close to everything. So from the standpoint of basically renting a one bedroom apartment in downtown Chicago, there's no place better and I enjoyed my corner room as it was very quiet and cosy. The downside is that the hotel rooms are in need of a face lift, new coat of paint, windows without a haze in the them, new carpet etc. The closet door was missing in my bedroom so when I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw each morning was my washing machine. But, my washing machine was the hero of my stay and I used it every day. The breakfast was adequate. The staff were friendly and helpful. The elevators were painfully slow so have some patience. Overall, if you can overlook the tiredness of this hotel and you need a washing machine/dryer or a kitchen, then by all means, this is perfect. Dear 5KPK,Thank you so much for your 4 star review. I am so happy to hear that you made our hotel your second home in Chicago. Our rooms are converted apartments so they are very large and great for long term stays. We do have future plans for various updates for the property. Currently we are replacing sofas and have replaced our top floors with new stainless steel appliances. Other updates included New Breakfast room furniture, common area updates and new a new lobby. Each year we update a new item.

The living area was spacious and had a small pull out sofa, a chair and desk area. Plenty of room to rest or visit when not seeing the sights. The location was great for seeing Millennium Park, boat tours, theater for Hamilton and the Mag Mile. It was easy to stop in to our room to have a short rest, or somewhere to put up your feet for 30 minutes while out seeing Chicago. The breakfast area was slightly cramped, but we always found a table. It offered pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, cereals, yogurts, breads and fruit. My only downfall would be the pull out bed-it had the bar, like majority of pull out sofas do. But it definitely was not the worst that Ive slept on. I slept fine all 3 nights we stayed there. If you are taking the train in, get off at the State Lake stop. It was an easy 5 minute walk from there. I would definitely come back to this hotel. Dear Carriehep,Thank you so much for your recent 5 star review. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed our prime location on Michigan Avenue.

Location could not be better, lots to see and do in the area, and lots of dining options.Not such positives:Daily housekeeping could do a better job - cleaning off kitchen counter, throwing away used coffee cups, etc. Rooms are a bit dated, and the sofa bed is in serious need of a new mattress (could feel every spring). Air conditioning was not great - especially in the hallway near our room. Only 2 elevators (tall, narrow hotel) so sometimes had to wait quite a while to get back to our room (or down to the lobby). we were on the 20th floor, so walking down stairs was not a great option.Dear TravlinGal1959,Thank you so much for your recent 4 star review.

Now that I've spent two nights there, I can tell new readers what to believe.The good: 1. The location is excellent. Close to El stations, downtown shopping, the river, and the park. There are good restaurants nearby, like Sweetwater, as well as a couple of fast food places. And if you need something for your mosquito bites, Walgreen's is also very close. But if you want any groceries for the little kitchenette in your room you will have to either bring them with you or find City Groceries about three blocks away.2. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. Ask them anything--they just want to please.3. The suites are quiet and have a bedroom with a very comfy bed, t.v., washer/dryer, as well as a living room and kitchen with a t.v. It felt like a little apartment. There are lots of windows, but not all of them have a great view many of them look on to other buildings.The not so good: 1. ELEVATORS. There are only two VERY SMALL elevators for 26 floors, and during our stay one of them was out of service. About 25 of the time, the elevator was too full and we had to wait (and wait!) for it to come back. This can really slow you down. Of course, there are stairs, so if you're fit and on a low enough floor, this might not be an issue.2. BREAKFAST. Comfort Suites offers a free continental breakfast that is quite mediocre. Poor quality (cheap) sandwich bread for toast, stale donuts, bagels, and pastries, cereal, waffles, sausage links, scrambled egg patties, juices, coffee, and fruit (only apples and bananas). It's a busy place in the morning and it's over at 9:00 am.So, in my opinion the good outweighs the bad and I can recommend this hotel with this advice: 1. Ask for a room on one of the lower floors, and 2. If a tasty breakfast is important to you, do some research and find a good restaurant.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience. We cannot thank you enough for your understanding and patience during the elevator issue we experienced. We certainly try to put our best foot forward and apologize for this inconvenience during your stay. We apologize that the breakfast offerings did not meet your expectations.

The staff was very friendly - when we needed some extra supplies for the kitchen they were brought to our room very quickly.

Location was excellent as it was close to bus stops and centrally located to most everything you would want to go and see. Staff was very helpful and polite. The only thing I would say is the breakfast was a little lame even for the choice hotel line. All three mornings we went for breakfast the food was either cold or not there at all. No butter, coffee was never full, bread items ran out and were not refilled promptly. If they could fix the breakfast problems they would get 5 stars from me.Dear Joseph P,Thank you for taking the time to write a review on your experience with us. We are very glad you enjoyed your stay.I am sorry that you did not have a great breakfast experience. I will bring your issue up with my team and make sure to correct them.We look forward to your returning again on the futureRobert HumphreyGeneral Manager",

The staff is the best, helpful, friendly, and outgoing. The room we had this time was the Penthouse with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. I believe there are two penthouses but I don't know if they are both 2 bedrooms. We had a small balcony and a view of the park and Sears/Willis Tower. The room itself was in need of some cosmetic repair,peeling wall paper, paint scraped in spots, water damage marks. The place was functional for us and we did not complain, we were just happy to be back in Chicago. The room we had on our first visit was an executive suite facing the River and was in much better condition. This will continue to be my go to place in Chicago because of the staff and I know that not all rooms are in need of repair. I still believe this is one of the best hotels in Chicago. Thank you Comfort Suites staff!Thank you so much for sharing your experiences and your loyalty to our hotel. I am so pleased that you enjoyed the space in your room. We will certainly ensure we work to ensure any repairs are completed. The staff will be thrilled to see your kind compliments on their service.

We were initially underwhelmed entering the small, dark lobby and small elevators- but wow, the rooms are fantastic!

The service was very good the entire time- coffee at the (free!) breakfast was pretty good, the wifi worked and the beds were comfortable. The price was right, even on a busy 4th of July holiday, and the location is very convenient for Millenium Park/ Lakefront activities, as well as walking distance to the art museum, water taxis, or Michigan Ave shopping.

Knowing that it would be impossible to return home that night we stopped at a rest area made a reservation at the Comfort Suites on Michigan Avenue. After a day of exploring exhibits, we left the museum campus in miserable weather but were treated to a magnificent night at this fantastic hotel. Not only was the location perfect for the view convenience to destinations, the room was large (and included a washer dryer in the closet to handle the wet clothes), the staff was friendly helpful the breakfast more than filled the boys. We've already made two more reservations for this location. Dear grandmaw2016,Thank you for your recent 5 star review. We are so happy that you enjoyed our location, room and breakfast. That is great you made multiple reservations for future stays. Thank you! We love our returning guests.We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager",

When we arrived early they stored our luggage, so we could tour the city. Brandon, especially was very good to us. He helped with directions, maps, luggage, and even hailed a cab for us, The room was awesome, It was comfortable, clean, and we were surprised to see a washer and dyer in an out cove. The location was near all the touristy places, shopping malls, and easy to access transportation. The breakfast was great and had a great variety of food to choose from. We really loved our room and the service at this hotel..They only have two elevators, so that can be a small problem. When one of the elevators broke down, they had one of their managers running it manually, which was very helpful, and the service man was there very quick. I would definitely stay there again, and would recommend it highly.Dear Lorraine R,I am so thrilled that you enjoyed your stay!

We really appreciate it and hope that you will come to visit us again soon!Kindest regards, Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager",

Upon arrival at hotel, we were just a tad too early, so our room was not quite ready. The front desk agents offered to hold our bags for us while we went and grabbed a bite to eat while our room was getting ready. When we arrived back, we checked in, which was super quick and fast! We were offered a free upgrade for a city view.....it was AMAZING! Before hopping onto the elevator, we grabbed a complimentary coffee and water from their 24 hour hydration station. When we arrived into our room, it was better than expected! Room is HUGE, especially for being in downtown Chicago. The kitchen is equipped with a stove, fridge, and breakfast bar area, living room has a desk, couch, tv, and large windows that open out that allow for awesome views! Bedroom is in a separate room....bed is SUPER comfortable which was great for us after a really late night out in the city!!! We did not take advantage of the complimentary hot breakfast, because we woke up later than we planned to and was rushing to catch our train. Next time we visit, we will hopefully take advantage of it! If you are looking for a great hotel with WONDERFUL staff, comfortable beds, large rooms, and GREAT location...book NOW, you won't be disappointed!!! We travel to the city several times a year, stay in many different hotels, and this will now be our go to hotel every time we come to Chicago! We look forward to coming back as guests in June for our 5 year wedding anniversary!Dear StephanieLaFrance,I am so thrilled that you enjoyed your stay!

The elevators were fast (good for a claustraphobic like me!), our suite was roomy and had all the conveniences we needed, and the view of the river, the street below and the amazing architecture around us was outstanding! Other than taking the Metra one day to the Museum of Science and Industry, we walked everywhere. There were more restaurants, shopping and theatres close by than we could ever visit in one trip. I felt totally safe at all times, and having a 7 Eleven just a few doors down was so convenient. I definitely recommend this hotel for families because of the washer and dryer, full kitchen and space. We had a large walk-in closet along with two smaller closets, and the living space was very spacious, even with two beds. Being in the middle of the shopping district and the park was great! All of the staff that we encountered were courteous, friendly and helpful. The parking was not a big deal (that actually was my biggest worry). We simply turned the car over to the attendant at the Hard Rock Hotel. We carried our bags ourselves to and from the hotel (a half block walk). The cost of parking is high, but it is everywhere in downtown. It did look like the self-parking lot was only a block further from the hotel, and we probably would use that next time, since we carried our own luggage anyway. (It's a lot cheaper) We did not move our car the whole time we were there, since everything was either within walking distance or the train.Dear smokemom,Thank you so much for your recent 5 star review. Your review was so great detailed. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay and our location. Thank you for all of the great comments.Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager",

This hotel is on Bourbon street on the corner of Bourbon and Toulouse - right in the heart of the French Quarter and within walking distance to everywhere - Jackson square, cafe du mond, excellent restaurants (check out my other reviews) and shopping.The rooms are fine, nothing fancy (the shower head was coming out of the wall, the bathroom is small, the carpet is worn and i think there was something wrong with the AC in my room 215 - no matter how high i turned it up it still felt like 65 degrees, so i called housekeeping and asked for a blanket. The bed is incredibly comfortable, and my room had a balcony with a view to the pool and the inner courtyard - fabulous!I want to send a shout out to two of the staff members - Allen, the bell captain who is friendly, knowledgeable,and incredibly helpful (ask him for recommendation for anything, he won't disappoint) and Bella, who saw me walk out of my room on a rainy day outside and immediately offered me a rain coat... I have never met so many nice people! I will be back.Thank you loves2travel2011 for sharing your experience with us. Please accept our apology for the inconvenience you experienced with the a/c and shower head. We have informed the appropriate hotel team to look into the issues and correct them moving forward. With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are delighted to hear that we have met your expectations.

We saw numerous trays of dirty dinner dishes on the hallway floors 12 to 15 hours after delivery. Seems it would be much cleaner and less (potential) bug-attracting to collect those dishes early in the morning, before breakfast is served. This issue seemed tacky to me, its the kind of thing guests shouldn't have an opportunity to observe. Instead, guests can't help but walk past lots of dirty dishes on their way to breakfast. Equally, dining room staff needs to be sufficient to keep the tables clean at the same rate of guest arriving for breakfast...or at least give us a place near the kitchen to bus our own trays! I saw lots of folks trying to find a clean table, while lots of other folks were trying to clean up after themselves.

They also have a very good restaurant with small fusion-like bites, very cool! De staff was very friendly and lovely cute breakfast buffet where you an sit in peace watching the morning news. When in Mimi will definitely return to the Vagebond!Thank you for staying with us and we look forward to your return visit. Glad you enjoyed the entertainment by the pool. We do have DJs Friday and Saturday nights from 8 to midnight.",

Pictures on the web-site depict what you get very well and it is well-positioned for North Miami, if that is where you really want to be.Why didn't I rate it as excellent Basically, the neighborhood still has a ways to improve, so it is not a destination area in itself. The excellent restaurant on site is closed on Mondays (one of the two nights we were there) and the breakfast is basic. Nevertheless, we felt welcomed and enjoyed the large, comfy room.We are so happy to know that you enjoyed your stay/room and felt welcomed by the staff! We certainly look forward to your return visit to Miami.We are centrally located as the airport, downtown Miami, the beach and most major attractions in Miami are only 15 minutes away from the hotel. It is true that our complimentary breakfast is basic as it consists of coffee/tea/OJ, croissants, yogurt, english muffins, cream cheese and jam.",

The rooms were stylish, newly-renovated, super clean (large rain shower bathroom), and the beds were very comfortable. The staff and admin were all so welcoming and accommodating throughout our stay and even let us enjoy the pool area after checkout! There was a Happy Hour party the night before the wedding and lots of guests were hanging out around the pool for several days (and nights!) surrounding the wedding. The vibe at the hotel was very chill. The food at the hotel restaurant was very good, according to those who ate there. The day after the wedding, we were up early and had coffee from the free continental breakfast area, but walked to a nearby diner rather than wait for the restaurant to open. There was even a free yoga class going on by the pool that morning. I would highly recommend this hotel for its ambiance, value, and comfort.Seems that everyone from the wedding group enjoyed their stay last weekend and thank you for leaving us a lovely review!",

This place transported me back to my childhood and family vacas at Florida motels. It is very updated with all of the modern conveniences. Great rooms comfortable and well appointed. There was a pool party on Saturday form 1-7:30pm where music was played quit loud all day. However we were gone most of the day and this didn't bother us too much. Also, we were informed via email prior to our arrival about it. All in all a wonderful place. Continental breakfast is free to guest. The hotel restaurant is great! A little pricey but there are many places near by to eat.The hotel is located in the historic Mid Century Modern district and it was fully renovated less than 4 years ago - we stayed true to the architecture and design of the 1950s era.We do have pool parties only during the summer season (3 a month) for our hotel guests and local residents to enjoy. We try to manage the noise level as best as we can and adhere to noise ordinances. We hope you return for a visit soon!",

                "text": "We were in Miami to visit family and had stumbled across this motel via the web and felt between the unique look and great location, it was worth a gamble. We were not disappointed. In fact, if it was not for one item, we would have rated the motel excellent.I told my wife that this motel was like an oasis amidst the neighborhood commercial buildings. The amount of landscaping around the pool area and rooms provided a sense of privacy and relaxation. It has an old fashioned look from the outside, which is repeated within the rooms themselves. The rooms were plenty large, the bed was very comfortable, the air-conditioning kept us comfortable, even though we faced the hotter western sun. And the sound-proofing was such that we could barely notice the music being played at night at the pool bar. The shower is quite large, but is also the source of my complaint. During showers, water would go from comfortable to very hot to very cold, even though we had not touched the settings. If you waited a few seconds, the temperature would go back to normal, but it was a true annoyance. I agree the continental breakfast was slim, but was very pleased to see that it was constantly restocked very often. And the best part was the coffee. My wife is so tired of watered down hotel coffee. She really enjoyed the morning brew and that is saying something.Every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. As noted, the restaurant is currently closed for renovation, which was a disappointment as our family had told us how enjoyable it is. Also, please note that parking is in a horseshoe shape on the outside edge of the building. We had no concerns about the neighborhood, but would certainly advise against having anything of value visible in the car. Would we stay here again Absolutely yes, but we would hope that the shower issue has been resolved in the future.Thank you so very much for your feedback and so glad you truly enjoyed your stay. Hopefully you will be returning sooner rather than later. We do service our heaters on an annual basis even though they are relatively new and in fact they were serviced less than a month ago which is why I am quite irritated that you experienced temperature fluctuations in your room. Another service call has been made and the issue will be dealt with promptly.By the way, we always advise guests not to leave valuable items in their cars anywhere in Miami.",

I travel to Miami about 6 to 8 times a year to visit family and I feel like I'm becoming an expert on where to stay for what. Technically, you could stay at this hotel and never leave the immediate area, and be okay. The place is clean, new, well kept, relaxing, with a friendly staff. The bathroom is pretty excellent and the room I was in felt enormous. (bathrobes included btw) The pool looked great, but it rained when I was there. I also saw a lot of space to lounge around outside if the weather permitted. Because of the design, architecture and foliage, when you're in the motel, you feel like you're in a private spot. You can't really see out which is nice. This helps create an atmosphere. If you venture outside the grounds, there's plenty of small restaurants within walking distance: the place is on a block with at least 5 restaurants to the south. To the north, things are waiting to be updated including 2 other motels. I think when they are done, this area will really come alive.I parked for free, which is hard to find in Miami. The neighborhood was safe, so I ordered from a few restaurants online and walked to pick up food. They were working on an onsite diner which I think would complete the whole experience when done. Location-wise, it's subjective. It's kind of off the beaten path in terms of South Beach or Downtown, but I liked being on Biscayne Blvd. And with a car, I could drive right up to the Aventura mall and the Gulfstream Casino, but I also wasn't too far to get to family in Miami Beach. Where it is on Biscayne makes it relatively easy to get around and you skip a lot of the freeway traffic. I'll definitely keep my eye on this place. I'd love to stay again when the diner is done and the weather permits for some poolside bar time. I'm also curious how this area will develop in the next few years.Thank you so much for such a lovely review and we do hope you return soon. The restaurant should re-open in early October as upscale Sushi so hopefully you can plan your next trip in the fall. The area has certainly changed since we totally renovated the hotel back in 2014, with only a few more buildings still in need of renovations. Stay tuned as the neighborhood continues to change!",

I recommend renting a car and doing little day trips, but no matter what, there's nothing like the Vagabond pool vibe.

The showers, the lighting.. even the smallest details lend themselves to the laid back environment. They have pool parties near the outdoor, colorfully lit bar each night- frankly they close down at just the right hour and we've never been disturbed.

Not being familiar with San Diego, I appreciated the easy access to I-8 and the convenient location. Most importantly I felt safe, both in the motel and the surrounding area. Motel is two stories but I heard no noise from other rooms or outside and found my room quiet.I am an early riser and enjoyed getting my continental breakfast and free USA Today each morning and going out by the outdoor pool to sit. The area is nicely landscaped with lots of flowers and shrubs.The room was exceptionally clean and alrhough on the small side had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again.Hello Joan W, Your 5 star review is greatly appreciated by our entire staff here at the Lamplighter Inn! Our goal is to provide spotless rooms, superior customer service and amenities that make our guests stay as comfortable as possible. It sounds like you were able to enjoy our hotel to the fullest and that makes us happy! We are glad you found us to be conveniently located.

Our front desk staff are ready to help with directions or suggestionsjust ask! Again, thank for your positive words! Your review not only encourages us to keep up the good work, but it also gives potential guests an insight as to what we are about.

From the time I made the reservation with Len Regan until I checked out early Monday morning, I was treated like a valued customer. Len upgraded me to a suite without any prompting on my part. He provided excellent, concise directions to public transportation as well as provided a coupon for a Trolley Tour of the city. The Lamplighter, while an older hotel, is very well maintained and super clean. It's third generation American family owned. The landscaping is lush, the breakfast is more than a continental and very tasty. The team spirit among the employees and staff was most noticeable. I observed an array of elderly folks who seem to be frequent guests and discovered many have been coming for two to three month stays for many years. There are good restaurants within walking distance. All in all, I would highly recommend this Best Western.",

Although it has a 'motel' look (two story buildings with outside doors) it is well maintained and has well kept grass, plants and flowers which give it a more friendly feel. There is a small but clean pool which is set up with beach chairs with towels on them for your convenience. There is a nice little breakfast set up (pastries, bagels, cereal and make your own waffles) served until 10am every morning. Its a great way to start the day and save a bit of money on food. We stayed in a suite which was very spacious (small sitting room with a pullout couch and then an attached room with a nice sided bed) and perfect for me, my husband and our young son (there's no door between the rooms - so don't look for privacy). One of the best features is Len - a member of staff at the hotel. He is very friendly, seems to know most everyone by their name and is a fount of information. We checked in daily with him for the scoop on things we were considering seeing. The only downside to the hotel is the location. Its not terrible - but its not a 'walking' friendly place. There are a lot of little local shops (drug stores, nail salons, that sort of thing) but nothing necessarily 'pretty' or tourist friendly places. That being said, it is very easy to get in a car and drive to many of main attractions of San Diego - and the staff is more than happy to give you driving information to them. Our original plan was to stay in Old Town (which after seeing we absolutely love!) but the hotels were sold out. If you're looking for a decent place to rest your head and are willing to hop in your car for short distances to get to places than I would recommend the Lamplighter.",

We work hard to keep our rooms and property ultra clean and well maintained, our staff consistently offers superior service to all our guests. Thank you for recognizing our efforts! We appreciate your honest remarks. We are so sorry you had a few odd incidents during your stay. Unfortunately, there are some things that we cannot control. Our parking lot can get a little tight, especially during sold out nights. Many guests with larger vehicles choose to park on the street for that reason. The area that we are in is generally a safe business/residential area and fortunately, we have not had any negative reports from people who have chosen to park on the street. We do warn guests that early Tuesday mornings, street sweeping takes place and tickets are given to anyone parked during those hours. As far as the shampoo dispensers go, we have found a solution to this problem and are currently taking care of it so that it does not continue to be an issue. Your two suggestions have been passed on to the GM for consideration. We value our guests input and are always working on improving our little hotel.

I find it impossible to believe that the Lamplighter is the second-highest rated hotel in all of San Diego!It is not great value for the money it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The lush landscaping of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad.The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient. But it does not by any stretch of the imagination deserve the inflated rating it now enjoys on TripAdvisor.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. We appreciate hearing from all of our guests. These reviews show us not only our areas of strength, but also the areas in which we can improve. TripAdvisor measures only one thing, guest satisfaction. It is not a measure of luxury or location. On TripAdvisor, an economy hotel can score very well and a luxury hotel can score poorly. It is clearly displayed on TripAdvisor that our hotel class is a 2-star (were a AAA 2-diamond property), with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. There definitely are hundreds of luxurious hotels in San Diego to choose from, but at a much higher cost and possibly a lower level of guest satisfaction. Our rating on TripAdvisor is a byproduct of our single-minded dedication to consistent service, quality, and value. We are proud of the ambiance we have created with the space we have available to us. We definitely dont have the grounds that a larger hotel might have, but we have taken great effort to fill our space with colorful plants, flowers, vines, and many lovely palm trees. Its an expense many mid-market hotels arent willing to incur. Regarding your room, it is a kitchen layout that is very popular with many guests staying for long periods as they have full size appliances and plenty of counter space. While none of them are stocked, we do provide full kitchen packs upon request. We do this to protect our guests. We have learned from experience that by keeping the kits in a sealed container, we can ensure that when a new guest arrives, the kit they receive will be clean, complete and in good condition. Im sorry this was not explained to you. Our company culture is to provide outstanding customer service, quality and value to our guests. We manage two hotels in San Diego, we are proud that both are in the top 15 on TripAdvisor. Thank you again for your review. We do appreciate the comments.

The hotel was near the zoo/Balboa Park and was a reasonable distance from Sea World and the beach. El Cajon Blvd has many ethnic (Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Kosher) restaurants and the usual fast food chains. We did not see any restaurant chains such as Outback, Denny's, or Chili's near the hotel. There are several grocery and drug stores nearby. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood with our kids.Our room was clean with updated bedding and furniture and had a fridge and microwave. It was not large, but adequate for our needs. We did not have any problems with noisy neighbors or noise from the street during late-night hours. The free continental breakfast was good. The only thing I found missing was yogurt. We asked for advice and directions from the front desk several times and they never led us astray. We also purchased discount zoo tickets from the front desk. We used the pool once and it was fine.I agree with another reviewer that it is just a motel.

                "text": "Sorry for not sharing the excitement of previous reviewers... We spent 6 nights in this hotel, which we chose based on the reviews here, and were not very happy. I'll try to break in down to pros and cons:Pros:- It is a decent, well-maintained property. - Housekeeping was great, the room was very clean and the grounds are beautifully landscaped.- Breakfast was better than expected, had a wide selection and kept us (and kids) happy for the first half of the day.- Most of the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful, especially the front desk manager.Cons:- Location!! The hotel is located in a remote, not-so-good part of town (not a bad neighborhood, just a commercial street dotted with hookah lounges and pawn shops). Getting anywhere in the city took about 20 minutes drive and was quite frustrating.- The room, although spacious and comfy, does NOT contain fridge and/or microwave, which made it difficult to stay with kids.- They charge for cribs in the room - 5 per crib per night, which would add up to quite a hefty amount. We have been traveling with young kids for the past 6 years, and this is the first time we were charged for crib. On checkout, when the front desk lady asked if everything was ok, I said that I was unhappy with this extra charge - she just shrugged and said it was the manager's decision. Great.To sum it up: for families with young kids like ourselves, I'd suggest not to be tempted by the reasonable price and positive reviews, but rather pay more attention to the details and choose a hotel closer to downtown.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for sharing your experience with the TripAdvisor community, and for choosing the Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites. Thank you for mentioning what you enjoyed about your stay your compliments are appreciated. I am truly sorry that your experience was not what you had hoped. Our goal is to exceed every guests expectations, and we take it very seriously when we fail.Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites is a AAA 2-diamond property. We tend to rate highly with those who appreciate great customer service, clean rooms and want the most for their dollar. While we do charge 5 for a crib, we also include many free amenities that you may end up having to pay for in more expensive hotels, including those in the downtown area. We offer free wireless internet, free parking, free coffee and tea all day, DVD players in all guestrooms, a thoughtfully selected free movie library, and a complimentary expanded continental breakfast that includes much more substance than a standard continental breakfast, we offer hard-boiled eggs, steel-cut oatmeal, freshly made bagels and pastries, juices and make-your-own-waffles. As you mentioned, the hotel property is very well maintained, with clean, lush, and beautifully landscaped grounds. The guestrooms are spotless, as well as spacious and comfy. We appreciate that you noticed this about our rooms. I apologize that a refrigerator was not included in your room type. We do have rooms equipped with microwaves and mini-fridges, as well as rooms with efficiency kitchens. Next time you stay, please feel free to ask for a room with a refrigerator or a full kitchen. I am truly sorry that our location was not convenient for you. We are about a mile away from San Diego State University, which is very convenient to a lot of our guests. Being close to the University, we are also in close proximity to many great restaurants and eclectic coffee shops. The freeways 8 and 15 are minutes away, so getting almost anywhere in San Diego takes less than 20 minutes. We are in a very central location, pretty much the middle of San Diego if you look at a map.Thank you again for choosing to stay at the Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites, and for taking the time to write a review. We take guest satisfaction very seriously, and we are constantly trying to improve. Your feedback will help us do that. Our philosophy is to provide clean, quality accommodations, genuine hospitality, and exceptional service that is still a great value. We take pride in making every guests stay an enjoyable one. We are not everyones cup of tea, but we do hope you will give us another opportunity to serve you in the future. * Book Direct with Us - For the Best Service, Selection, and Value! * Yours in Hospitality,Alex Customer Service AgentBest Western Lamplighter Inn Suites at SDSUVisit our Hotel Website or Call Us at (800) 545-0778",

I am a travel concierge, because of their stalwart commitment to service, I will continue to recommend the Courtyard by Marriott to my clients.

We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay. Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter's wedding just a few miles away, their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional. While the entire hotel staff was amazing, I can't begin to bestow the appropriate amount of gratitude and praise Lisa and Jean deserve for their unrivaled professionalism and basic kindness...Well Done!!!",

We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone.",

I might actually like this hotel a little better. The rooms aren't quite as nice and there is no free happy hour snack time but it's a lot easier to get around to stuff downtown. There are a ton of restaurants within walking distance (over by Amazon). I'd prefer to self park instead of valet park though. The rooms are nice enough and they have a mini-fridge and microwave.Carolyn, I'm thrilled that you enjoyed your stay with us! I know there are a lot of choices around this area, so it's great for me to read that we impressed you.

The rooms are very small and tight with two beds. Note that two beds will most likely be 2 doubles, not queens. The bathroom needed work, It wasn't the cleanest. Old door and moldy corners. The grounds of the motel are very nice. However, keep in mind that many temporary workers and hotel help obviously live in the motel. Ask for an upstairs room, the lower rooms are loud. And stay away from rooms across from the laundry. It has a nice pool and hot tubs. The staff was friendly. It is easy access from Interstate 8 and close to the Trolly Stop and Fashion Valley Mall.Dear Traveler, Thank you for your comments regarding your most recent stay with us. We apologize that our property did not live up to your expectations. In regards to the hotel help, our employees are not allowed to stay at the property, but we do have regular guests who work in construction as well as government contractors who work at the Naval shipyards. It pleases us that you enjoyed our convenient property and the friendliness of our staff, and hope that you will reconsider staying with us in the future.

I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!Dear Sally C.,Thank you for your review, we appreciate your valuable feedback.

We would like to apologize for the service you received at the front desk, as our company believes that each of our guests should experience exceptional service when they stay at one of our hotels. The front desk may not have had a situation that played out as yours did before, but we have spoken with the department on how to handle these things better. We are an older property, and like all houses and buildings, there is occasionally the visit from bugs. We undertake a comprehensive pest control program which includes regular visits from a specialist pest control organization for preventative maintenance. It is important to advise our guests that silverfish are indeed not related to bed bugs. We take bed bugs very seriously, as they are an infestation that can travel and affect guest comfort, however we take all bug visitors seriously since your feedback we have notified housekeeping and our pest control department to monitor the area. Regarding your further comment about reheating your food, unfortunately the San Diego County Health Department will not allow food into our kitchen that does not come from a permitted Food Distributor. We are sorry this was an inconvenience for you. Thank you for staying with us and sharing your comments with us.Kind Regards Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff",

The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel. Next trip down to San Diego for another theatre show we will be staying here again. Can't recommend this place enough!

The staff are well trained and friendly and we actually are offered upgrades due to our BW Ride Rewards status. This does not happen at most BW hotels. The rooms are nice but a bit dated. We love the property since it really seems like a tropical resort. We come to San Diego quite often and will certainly make the BW Seven Seas our property of choice.Dear PaulSchm,Thank you for being a loyal guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and for taking the time to write your wonderful review. We are happy to hear that you were satisfied with our friendly staff and our convenient location. We are currently going through numerous renovations throughout the hotel, including granite counter tops for the bathrooms, wood cabinetry, and upgrading various amenities. Thanks again for your time and we look forward to accommodating you again soon!Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff",

The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest,We are happy to hear that you had a good trip to San Diego, but we are sorry that the Best Western Seven Seas did not meet your expectations. Our rooms are often booked months in advance, especially for the summer, and unfortunately we cannot always provide last minute bookings with a specific room type. We are in the process now of updating and upgrading our bedding package which includes mattresses. As for the late night disturbance, we apologize that you were not happy with the way the situation was handled. Guest disturbances should be handled in a very sensitive manner, and we have discussed the management of the issue during your stay with our team leaders and their staff. We are always looking for ways to improve and take your comments seriously. It is the mission of our company to see that each of our guests receives an excellent service experience and we are sorry that your stay did not turn out that way. We thank you for staying with us, and for your valuable input to how we can run our business better. Kind Regards and Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff",

Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card. Overall the grounds were well kept and the room was clean, but had poor appliance, electrical outlet and furniture placement. No elevator for 2nd floor rooms.",

                "text": "We were 4 women in a room with two double beds, in town for 4 days for a convention at the Town Country, happening just on the other side of the I-8 freeway. I'd say mostly positives for us! The property was obviously being attended to while we there, with gardeners replanting and pruning the day we were leaving, the exterior building was being washed down. Very nice plantings all about. Cafe, very satisfactory. Free parking very welcome. Our convention was only a 5 or so minute walk away. We were anticipating free breakfast with the reservation (was discussed when reservation was placed) but because we didn't have documentation of that, we weren't able to counter the front desk assertion that we did not have breakfast with the reservation. So be prepared with your paperwork. Just about once a day, 1 or more of us had our room key cards not work, so we had to go to the front desk to have them reset somewhat tiresome especially because we were housed in the furthest bank of rooms from the office. For the room, yes per other reviews, the a/c is set up such that it's an uneven situation, especially at night when sleeping. We dealt with it. Some sort of problem with shower pipes in the room above, when at 3 and 4 in the morning (!), a loud rattling pipes noise commenced, for a good 10 minutes. We alerted the front desk to the problem in the morning. The noise did not occur the next evening, but it could have been because then there was no one in the room upstairs afterwards during the span of our stay. Sure parking was very tight on the Saturday evening, but it was Saturday night, late we did eventually find a spot.Frig worked well. Plenty of towels. Room didn't at all seem overly dated. Beds were satisfactory. We indulged in the pool one late afternoon, but it ended up being the same time as what appeared to be a family reunion so shifted after a little bit to one of the hot tubs. Very nice nonetheless to have a pool and 2 hot tub options on the property. There is also a small gym facility adjacent to the pool.We would stay here again!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We welcome all guest comments especally when they are so well thought out. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests.

Room with 2 double beds was extremely small, hotel was quite dated and we felt uncomfortable. Thought we could get a roll-away bed with our room but they said it would not fit, They were correctm we could barely move in this tiny, tiny room! Will not stay here again.Dear levine331: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. We are currently undergoing a 2 million renovation, so exciting things are yet to come. Based on hotel occupancy, larger guestrooms are available, so we apologize if you felt our guestrooms were too small. Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations in San Diego and hope you will consider staying with us again, so we may have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience.

                "text": "I took my almost 13 year old niece to San Diego. We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable. There is a plug issue with two outlets where refrig, blow dryer and coffee maker plug in. It wasn't too much of an issue because we just unplugged the refrig when we briefly needed the other appliances. Mirrors didn't bother us and they do make the room feel larger. Room was very clean, bedding was clean and of fairly good guality. Probably the biggest negative was thin walls and doors that you could not close quietly. So we heard noise above us and we were bolted awake one morning by a neighbor 's slamming door at 6:30am. Plenty of free parking. beautiful grounds, sparkling clean pool, nice jacuzzi and great location. Hotel shuttle driver was very nice and reception crew was always helpful. I also appreciated the free computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes. I would stay at this hotel on another trip to San Diego.",

Tell me, how clean do you expect 10 year old carpet to be The lack of an in-room microwave and no poolside towels are two notable deficiencies. Most Best Western's provide some sort of a breakfast but this place does not. Having said that, the location in Mission Valley is very convenient and when you factor in free parking and discount pricing (from Hotwire / Priceline)... this place is actually a decent value. A Crown Jewel in the Best Western Empire IT IS NOT... but for a short stay at a convenient place in San Diego with free parking, the discount price may offset some of the limitations.",

I didn't use the fitness room as looked a bit 'testosterone laden' with too many men working out for me, but the pool was clean and warm.It's in a strange situation on 'the Hotel Circle' which literally is a circular route of hotels with an elevated highway running alongside them, about 3-4 miles from downtown, so there is a bit of traffic noise, but Downtown hotels are ALL on the flight path of either the Navy airstrip or the international airport!

She was able to do this even though it was close to midnight.The TV box was stolen from the new room as well (these must be popular in the USA...lol), but the great maintenance man was able to get one from another room and install it the next day for us.The hotel itself was very close to lots of activities, so the location is good, but if you want a nicer room, go with 2 queens or a king.",

I really wanted to eat there as the food looked amazing last year, but we chose to dine somewhere else. Our hotel room was beside a meeting room that was booked both mornings of our stay so we were woken up at 6:45am both days. Their food beverages were set up outside our window so it was loud and we were not able to sleep in. The hotel itself is beautiful and the hot tub pool area is a lot of fun. The rooms are a bit difficult to locate as there are multiple buildings and levels.",

Anyway, the staff was friendly and quick to serve us. It was 2am so there wasn't a line. But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card. So I stayed here to earn points. But, note to self: won't be staying here for an extended stay. Can't say I'd recommend it to others.",

About 15 minutes walk to Pike Place Market and 5 minutes to many shopping stores. Lots of restaurants/dining options nearby too. Stayed in a Spectacular room which were fairly spacious and modern. I liked the Bliss product toiletries in the rooms. There is a Nespresso machine in the room. They didn't have any tea/kettle though. Staff were friendly. Their whatever/whenever service is pretty efficient. Now for some of the cons. The temperature in the room was difficult to regulate. Every tiny adjustment would make the room either too hot or too cold. There aren't enough towel bars or hooks to hang towels in the bathroom. The gym was unkept. Noticed some used towels and opened water bottles laying around. Upon check out, we requested for a bellman and followed up two times and no one came. Ended up bringing everything down ourselves and noticed bellmen in the lobby who apparently weren't aware of our request. They were pretty friendly so not sure if it was just some miscommunication between the hotel staff. Had a good stay but not sure if I would stay here again because I wasn't wowed as much as I thought I would be staying at a W hotel. Might go back to staying at the Sheraton Seattle.Hello Kenneth L, thank you very much for your review of your recent stay at W Seattle. So glad to hear that you had a good stay, but I apologize that we missed the mark on some things for you! Our team works hard here to provide great customer service, so your feedback is incredibly valuable to us to improve those experiences! I do hope you will try us again next time and allow us to WOW you as we should have done this time. Thanks again.",

I was traveling with a group of just over 20 people and upon our arrival they had all our rooms ready for check in. But, not only that, they also had all our keys labeled with our names and room numbers already on them. That made for such a smooth registration and check in (as well as check out). Our stay was for 4 days and 3 nights. Another convenience the hotel provided was a shuttle ride to and from the SD Zoo. Eliminating the chore of fighting through traffic, driving (in an unfamiliar area), and parking. The rooms were well maintained, clean and had small refrigerators in each room. The hotel also has a pool (which we didn't have time to use) and a restaurant serving home cooked meals on site. I also liked that it was quiet.Dear MariaLC60: Thank you for your nice remarks in regard to your recent stay. It is certainly appreciated! We are so glad that you enjoyed our friendly and efficient Staff, as well as our complimentary shuttle service that offers transportation to many local area attractions. It is a delight knowing you also appreciated our well maintained guestrooms, quiet property, and the convenience of a pool. Perhaps, you will have the chance to utilize it on your next visit.

And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations and would be happy to host your next visit to San Diego and provide you with an excellent stay given the chance.

The room smelled strongly of cleaner enough to make my eyes water. The two control knobs on the A/C unit were broken and amateur repaired so that they did not work. The soap in the bath, down to a sliver, was not replaced. The coffee supplies were not replenished and the waste basket not emptied. They allow people to wander around the facility slipping flyers for other restaurants under the doors not a warm feeling for security awareness. The Cafe served an excellent breakfast good food and excellent friendly staff. I'd suggest you do not pay the up-charge to get breakfast 'included' in the room cost. You can get a good breakfast at the Cafe for much less than the higher room rate, and, if you want to go somewhere else, there are dozens of other restaurants in walking distance. Next time, I'll try a different hotel chain and walk over to the BW Cafe for breakfast.",

Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.Thank you for being our guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and taking the time to review our property, we really appreciate your feedback. Hopefully we'll welcome you back soon on your next trip to San Diego.",

                "text": "I will start with the major issue. This Best Western has no staff that reads of que. It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again.",

All good, rightNo...upon check-in, they add a 75 block to your credit card, and say it'll stay from 5-7 business days. That's outrageous, and when I asked why, was told people steal TV's from the rooms. If so, 75 doesn't cover a replacement (and they should rent to better people!). Short-sighted for them I was going to book another night a few days later, but learned they'd block an additional 75...this is building customer loyaltyOn check-out, a guest was complaining that she had no hot water for 3 days...the front desk clerk's attitude was 'management cut back on maintainance. Lovely. Worse, the morning shuttle I'd booked and they reconfirmed the night before was cancelled as the van driver decided to help a family load suitcases into the van......at which point to desk clerk called me a taxi and had the hotel pay for it - a VERY generous gesture!Like I said, a difficult review to write. I wonder if management knows just how hard it's employees work to keep the customers happy",

Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location.",

When we arrived, we needed to make a left turn in order to get to the parking lot of the Hotel. Making that left turn seemed nearly impossible and very dangerous! The traffic on Orange Blossom makes getting in and out of the parking lot seemingly impossible and we almost had an accident! We checked into room 284...on the 2nd floor and had tons of luggage because we were in town for a Fashion Show. Low and behold, the hotel has NO elevators! What!! How do you operate a hotel that has a second floor with no elevators The guy at the front desk almost laughed out loud when he told us there were no elevators...not because it was funny but because he too, thought it was ridiculous! We had to lug heavy bags up the stairs only to get there and find that the room was horrible. There was a musty moisture in the air as soon as we walked in and the room felt very stale and unclean. The walls had been caulked to fill in several holes and I do mean SEVERAL HOLES but they didn't even attempt to match the paint. The wall was painted yellow but the caulked portion was painted over with orange. The sheets and comforters on both beds had yellow stains and brown stains all over. The carpet was stained, possibly with urine because it smelled heavy with urine near the stain. The bathroom looked very old and cheaply constructed with peeling paint and stained walls. The hotel was pet friendly but I don't think they spray regularly for fleas because we all had flea bites after only being in the room for a few hours. The halls smelled really bad and especially in the stairwells. One huge thing that stood out was that there were several young women, dressed very scantily, walking up and down the street in the area near the hotel in the late evenings. I do believe there was heavy prostitution in the area and this hotel and other hotels in the area are used for that purpose. We decided that we could not sleep comfortably in this hotel and checked out the same night. The weekend that we were in town was a busy weekend due to the All Star event so most hotels were booked solid. We searched and searched and found a hotel with only one room left! We booked it, packed up and high tailed it out of there! Ended up approximately 2 miles away at a Hampton Inn Suites where we re-showered, and slept comfortably in clean beds! Never again will I stay at a Baymont! We booked here for two reason...because the group we were in town for had blocked several hotels for their fashion show and this was one of them and number two, because most hotels in the area were already sold out. I will never stay at a Baymont EVER again!",

The check-in was smooth and the staff were top-notch professionals. The room was enormous and more important it was immaculate. My family and I stayed here during my son's spring break which was March 26 to April 2nd. A week of total bliss. The landscaping was so lush and tropical it was almost like going to a botanical garden. They get an A+ on this aspect alone. The hotel was so convenient to everything. The Florida mall was about a fifteen minute walk away and the variety in that mall was overwhelming and astounding. The area of the hotel was totally commercial not residental which made me feel very secure and safe. The breakfast was ample even though the place was croded beyond belief. The area around the pool was so clean and I could see that the deck was freshly painted. The pool was cool, refreshing and overall just delightful. I espcecially like the fact that there were benches for people to sit on all throughout the property, even at the front entrance as you come in.

The room was fairly clean. The washroom needs some upgrade.....The deeper side of the pool was much deeper than I thought, so be careful with kids while playing. The breakfast was satisfied for the rate we paid. The free on-time airport shuttle was a very good bonus. Overall a good affordable hotel to stay before flight.

It's a Baymont, its like on par with a Hampton Inn but at half the cost. This location on South Orange Blossom Trail is in a heavily built up commercial area. Heavy traffic, next to highways, and great retail shops. Best Buy, Nordstrom, Apple, Barnes and Nobles, The Florida Mall with 270 shops plus a hotel. Ghetto, I think not. The Millenia mall which is around 5 miles away is the ritzy mall, that was opened surrounded by a ghetto, but is doing quite well. Baymont has a great location. Next to mall, close to airport, close like 5 to 10 minutes from universal and seaworld, Disney is around 20 minutes. After spending time at the parks(Disney,Universal, Seaworld) you go out to the many restaurants of Orlando or go back to plop in the room for the next day. The rooms are clean, linens fresh, bathroom clean. Beds for some reason are excellent, very comfortable( I checked they are from Serta) Rooms are quiet. No complaints. Breakfast was just like ok, I like to go out to like IHop or Dennys on vacation, I am not into these FREE breakfast that people are hoarding like some incredible buffet. Hint easy entrance to get into on Landstreet(no waiting) Also its nice to have a 7-11 within walkin distance (2 minutes) from hotel for your latenight nosh.",

They give you two different pillows with different thickness on the same bed. Evening staff was nice and professional. There is a very big pool and the area was nicely landscaped around it. All the outside doors are supposed to be only opened by a room key but I did not see any one them actually working when I was there. Perhaps they lock them late at night and release them early in the morning. I didn't see any unsavory characters hanging around.There's a refrigerator and microwave, as I recall.

First, there was a misunderstanding of the people that made my reservation that were more focused in grabbing your money out of your pocket than helping and listening to the guest. They were pushing me so hard to reserve a room instantly that they did not hear when I said 2 nights. When I got to the hotel, The front desk agent helped me to get another night that wasn't in the reservation. The hotel was nothing to do with the online photos. The carpet was old, stained, dusty, and had bad odors the Lobby was dark. When I got to the room It was disappointed. The whole room stink, the carpet was all dirty and stained. The furniture old and scratched. Bathroom with hair in the floor, towels with holes. Beds were full size not queen. Pillows small and flat. Also I visited the pool which was dirty and with tree leafs in the bottom. I took breakfast in the morning it was small, No eggs, sausage, bacon, milk, only a basic breakfast. What I did like was the quietly of the room the friendly staff, nothing else. I will not come back again to this hotel, and I can not recommend it to anybody. Sorry, that's the very true.

                "text": "We found the Baymont Inn Suites through the list of Wyndham family of hotels, since we are Wyndham Rewards members and were looking to increase our points. Since we only needed a room for one night (less than 12 hours total) and for us and our 2 kids, we didn't need much, but they had a King suite with two rooms and a hideaway. This suited our needs. Unfortunately, the end result wasn't worth the money we paid for the room.To begin, the hotel is situated immediately next door to a local Mexican restaurant, and we got the feeling the hotel staff and the restaurant staff hang out often together in the hotel lobby or near the front desk when business is slow. There seemed to be a definite camaraderie with friendly conversation taking place when I checked in. To be fair, it was after 11pm when we arrived, and I know this changes the look and feel of a property.Checkin was smooth and easy and our room was in the main building on the 2nd floor. No elevators, though, so we had to lug 3 large suitcases and our 4 carry-on bags upstairs and down the hall without a cart. Also, just past the front desk and before the stairs there was a small room with a glass window and open door full of miscellaneous boxes, materials, and other paraphernalia, giving it a haphazard appearance.Once we arrived at our room, the key showed green but the door wouldn't open. We learned we needed to turn the handle up instead of down due to a low-battery keyed entrance.From the pictures on the web site, the rooms appeared much larger than they really are. Main room had mini-fridge, microwave on a counter, 2 chairs and a hideaway couch right next to each other, and a single dresser on which the TV sat, all in close proximity with not much room to move once the bed was unfolded. The entrance into the king bedroom was an opening which looked like they took duplicate rooms and cut a hole in the wall, because it was a mirror-reflection of the main room. The only difference is there was a closet area with no door and a king bed. No extra pillows or blankets, and the pillows on the king bed immediately flattened, thereby lacking support. The bed itself was quite hard and unforgiving.The rooms were clean, and the windows had nice treatments, but the lacks in other areas overshadowed that. If you're looking for an affordable stay with sufficient continental breakfast and basic amenities, this place would work. Plus, there are Wyndham Rewards points for your stay!",

The rooms are very spacious. The breakfast was not as good as most of the Hampton Inns where we have stayed. Probably my only complaint is, we did not feel particularly safe after dark. The number of homeless and/or intoxicated people who line the streets in this area and leading up to the hotel made us feel quite uncomfortable. They are quite aggressive and demanding.We drove our vehicle and took advantage of valet parking. You do not need a vehicle in New Orleans. The trolley stops near the hotel. However, it was always packed. I suggest either walking or taking a cab to wherever you need to go. If traveling with kids who like to take advantage of a pool, there was not a pool.Thank you for your recent stay with us and taking time to give us a review! Happy to see you enjoyed your stay overall and apologize that you were not happy with the breakfast. I would love to get more feedback on the breakfast and see what we could have done better. I also apologize that the area made you uncomfortable at night. Our area is very safe and we usually do not have a homeless issue so I do apologize if there were some uncomfortable encounters with them. I do hope that you enjoyed New Orleans and again would love more feedback about the breakfast.Thanks!",

The hotel was jammed with visitors and because I arrived late in the day, I got what must have been the last room, even though I had had a reservation for several weeks. I was put in a handicap-access room on the first floor, which was spacious and seemed quiet due to its location at the end of the hall. However, at 7:45 am the construction crew started working in the room directly over my head and I was awakened by the sound of someone scraping the floor above my bed. So much for sleeping in for a late work day ahead...I complained by phone to the front desk and they apologized and promised to move me for the second night of my stay. Two hours later I checked in at the desk to see if I could move before I had to leave for work, but was told that the hotel was again booked solid and they would see what could be done. At that point, I got angry and mentioned that I had requested the change hours before, I am a Hilton Honors member, and anything else that I could think of that would persuade the agent to make the change. She did point out that the renovation work was posted on their website, and there was a printed apology in the lobby, neither of which made me any less sleepy...She finally found a room on the third floor, which was above the floor being worked on, and I moved. It was a nicer room. HOWEVER, bright and early the next morning (Sunday) the sounds of a power nailer wafted up through the vent in the bathroom. Luckily, I had to be at work early that day anyway, so I was already up. If you are booked here, try to get as far from any renovation construction as possible. Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are very sorry that you werent happy with your guestroom during your recent trip. We try to accommodate all reservations but occasionally we cant meet every room request. Your feedback is important us. Were very sorry for the noise issue you encountered in the morning. Your comfort is our number one concern, and we appreciate that you brought this to our attention. Your review will help us correct similar issues in the future. I would like to hear more details on your stay. If possible you can contact me at Jessica.Jones2hilton.com. Our renovations are now completed and we hope that the next time youre in the area, youll consider staying with us again.Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport!",

                "text": "Over the years I have stayed at numerous Hamptons and been generally satisfied, but not now.We stayed at this Hampton for two nights. Somehow we got into a handicap room. The room was sparsely furnished with only one desk style chair no place to put a suitcase and hooks behind a curtain for a closet. The first issue was the heater which we set at 69 degrees. We went to bed early and at 11 PM woke up sweating to a temp of 84 degrees. Obviously the thermostat did not work. The handicap shower has a vertical slide to hold the shower head but it would not stay at the top nor would the sprayer stay vertical it would flop down. The real issue was a total lack of housekeeping when we returned on the second day. A coffee cup with an inch of coffee was still on the nightstand along with the ice bucket full of water and the bag half in the bucket. I had left it in front of the TV with the lid off so they could see it but they did not move it. In the bathroom there was a little powder on the floor from the morning which was still there, obviously they did not sweep or mop the floor. But the coup de grace was the toilet paper floating in the toilet. That was disgusting, they never touched the toilet to clean or someone used it while we were gone. Overall the hotel was noisy with trains going by during the night an you could hear voices from the lobby. The breakfast was mediocre with a small breakfast area. Look for a better place to stay then here. When I mentioned the issues to the desk clerk she took my number and said the manager would call. Now 72 hours later no call, what does that tell youThank you so much for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. Your feedback we truly appreciate as it helps us to make the necessary improvements. We truly apologize that we did not meet your expectations during your stay with our service.

On a recent trip to North Carolina, my wife and I were scheduled on an early flight, and we live about two hours away by car. Rather than awaken in the wee hours to make our flight, we drove to the Hampton the previous afternoon, parked our car in their designated parking lot, enjoyed a good sleep and a good breakfast, and were driven to the airport by van on the following morning. All things considered, the cost was reasonable and we didn't miss any sleep.Like all Hamptons, the facility was clean and comfortable, the staff was pleasant and helpful, and the breakfast was more than ample. This hotel seems to be showing its age a bit, but that didn't negatively impact our stay in any way. The location is very good as an airport hotel...the van will get you to the departures area in about ten minutes, but there are only two convenient restaurants nearby, a Ruby Tuesday and the restaurant in the nearby Embassy Suites, and there are no nearby shops (excluding the airport, of course).",

The room was comfortable, I asked for a refridgerator and although it was not placed in the room when I arrived all 3 times, it was promptly brought up after I checked in. The breakfast area is small but it was nice to sit in during the day. There was not too much variety to the breakfast items but everything was good. I also used the fitness center which had new equipment and was clean.Overall the staff was pleasant and helpful and the property was clean and comfortable. Unfortunately for a long term stay the surroundings are a little blah, not much to do unless you have time to venture into the city of Philadelphia. There is a Ruby Tuesday next door for dinner but aside from that I found you had to venture pretty far to find places to eat that weren't in a sketchy neighborhood although I will admit I didn't do too much exploring since I was very busy at work while I was there.It was a nicely run Hampton and I would stay there again if I were to be working in the area.",

I'll spare you the ugly details of what happened, but I can say that the ordeal ended on a very positive note. Somehow we wound up in Philadelphia en route to the Philadelphia airport and needed a clean, warm, close place to stay along with important features such as free hi-speed Internet access and a hot breakfast. The Hampton Inn was remarkable. The staff was gracious and the rooms were very pleasant. Little touches such as a long Ethernet cable that extended across the room, warm fresh cookies served in the lobby and free shuttle service from the train and to the airport made all the difference in 16 degree weather. We made it back to Los Angeles a few days later than planned, but the Hampton Inn made that delay manageable.",

We used stay and park or park and fly where we can leave our car there and the price is competitive.

We don't regret it one bit! We would definitely stay here again.Check-in was prompt and the staff was friendly. Our room was ready immediately upon arrival at 3PM. We got a room on the 5th floor with a nice view of the city skyline. The room was clean and spacious. We booked at king- bed room with a pull-out sofa bed and all four of us (all adults) slept comfortably. The HVAC unit was very efficient. When we came in there was cold air blowing, but after a slight thermostat adjustment it was very cozy. There is free Wi-fi in the rooms. All you need to log in is your name and room , so that was very convenient. We didn't notice any noise from neighboring rooms, but several doors slamming in the hallway at 5AM did not go unnoticed. I guess one should expect that from an airport hotel, however, since most travelers will be leaving early to catch a flight. An airport shuttle runs fairly frequently, but we weren't flying on this trip so we didn't use it. However, we did need a cab and had the front desk staff call for one. It arrived in less than 5 minutes! For meals, there is a Ruby Tuesday next door. We chose to dine in the city that night. We did, however, enjoy the free breakfast in the morning. Hot food, not just continental fare! The coffee was freshly brewed and the food was plentiful. That morning they served cheese omlettes and turkey sausage but I understand that the menu changes daily.Overall, a good hotel and the price was quite reasonable! We will definitely stay here again.",

And it is specifically the one at the Airport in Philly. This is a great hotel easily my favorite out of them all. Whenever we go away Internationally or within the USA we always stay here. Also love the Park and fly where they watch your car while you are away. This hotel did something for us that no other hotel has ever done . When we went away to Paris many years ago while we were sleeping they sent their driver out overnight and in the morning they gave us 2 Plane pillows to have on the flight. Those are a good 20 each . Just to say have a good time. Who does that !!! As a TY we brought them back some souvenirs and try to always give them something when we come back. We also Love the breakfast. Always at least 2 hots included and there are waffles you can make . Food has never run out . Recently late late at night the coffee was a little cold. I would have dealt with it but they insisted on me having hot coffee. They tied me up and made me wait for it . It was not so bad because i also had a cookie . If you have a flight before breakfast they have bag breakfast you can take with you. Of course drink the water before you get to the airport. The Park and Fly is great nice to know your car is safe while you are away. There is a Ruby Tuesday right next door too if you want dinner. When we got there they offered a wine as an arrival treat. Also a new nice touch is they actually when they pick you up at the airport offer to take you back to the HI for a nice drink before you leave . This is new and a nice thing to do. The only things i can say that would be better is work something out with the restaurant next door where maybe we get a discount or something. HI must give them a TON of business. A lot of places we stay we get a discount at the adjoining restaurant when you show your room card. Also it was a bit confusing in the airport looking for the kiosk that has the HI number to call for pickup. They moved everything and i wandered around looking for it never found it. Luckily i saw the van outside and he waited while we got the luggage. Other then that it is our favorite hotel to stay at for the Airport Stay.Thank you for your kind words and feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport.

The Lake Union location is not convenient for downtown where my wife was working but she was ok with the 1.6 mile walk and the hotel has a flawless shuttle system to take their customers back and forth from the downtown area. It runs like a bus line with specific stops at posted times. The staff was very pleasant and efficient. The Wednesday night manager's reception was the nicest of any residence where I have ever stayed. The is a small indoor pool with a whirlpool and a sauna. The fitness center is not great but better than average and certainly functional with all the equipment and cardio machines in good working order. Our room was very comfortable and quiet. The televisions were kind of chinsy but that's normal. The bed had the upgraded mattress and bedding that is now found in most Residence Inns. The housekeeping staff were pleasant and efficient. The property is attractive with a nice atrium and is well maintained. The breakfast is pretty much the same as every residence inn with the exception of better coffee (Starbucks) and a better than average presentation. Some people will like the location and others will find it difficult. There are plenty of nice restaurants on the lake but not much shopping and the shuttle stops running at about seven so there is a transportation issue if you want to go to dinner at a restaurant on the bay or downtown. We were comfortable walking but we walk a lot and we were lucky with the weather.",

The hotel is in a great location and we were able to walk to rent kayaks on Lake Union and to great restaurants and bars up the street. An Uber ride to Capitol Hill was quick and cheap. We had a one bedroom suite and since there was three of us, one slept on the pull out couch. The inconvenient thing about the room was the bathroom being located IN the bedroom which was awkward to use at night when people are sleeping in the bed. Also, there was no garbage in the bathroom area which was annoying for two ladies getting ready to go out. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The front desk was very helpful when we needed to store our luggage before check-in because of early arrival. I ate a salad from their restaurant one night and it was only okay, however, the breakfast was very good with lots of hot options and a waffle bar. Overall for the value, I would definitely stay again.Thank you for staying with us and leaving such a wonderful review. Cheers!",

There are restaurants, grocery stores and attractions within walking distsnce. It has has an exercise room, a coffee bar and taproom on premise. Public transportation is right outside the front door. My only complaint, ie-dissapointment, was what I thought was an outrageous charge of 30 per day for using the parking garage. To me this was an exorbitant fee for an already expensive hotel stay. Otherwise I was more than completely satisfied. Thank you for your fantastic feedback. We look forward to welcoming you back to Lake Union someday!",

Walking distance (20 min) from the space needle, EMP museum Chihuly garden. Rooms were good size and clean. Bathrooms were very small. Got a good rate even with 30 per day for parking. Staff was friendly and helpful. Tram line was just in front of the hotel so that was great for going to downtown considering the price of parking there. The problem we faced was the breakfast. They don't change the menu so imagine eating the same thing everyday for 3 weeks. They could easily change the menu and have different items. The other problem was housekeeping. They wouldn't keep enough toiletries. We were 5 people and they use to keep 2 tiny shampoo bottles in the 2 baths which was hardly enough for 2 people. We did complain so the asst. manager herself came with a lot of bottles and also apologized. However same thing happened again and again. Also my wife's night suit went missing, we did report it but was not found. Overall had a great time with some glitches and will definitely recommend for long stays and i hope they improve the breakfast.",

One day they didn't take out our trash or give us bath rugs or hand towels. The six of us in a two bedroom suite shared towels and used a washcloth -- a washcloth! -- for a rug. The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach. Nope. All they had was Mountain Dew.The location across from Lake Union was pretty, but not convenient for downtown activities. We had to wait up to 20 minutes for an Uber driver during peak hours. That was poor planning on my part to book here, but I had no idea that Uber would be so difficult. Despite the challenges, we did have a decent stay. Our two room suite was spacious and comfortable. And again, the breakfast was really fantastic.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us and providing your honest feedback. On behalf of our team, I apologize we fell short of meeting our expectations but most importantly yours. It is guest as yourself who help improve our hotel and provide better service in the future. I apologize for the inconvenience of your downtown travels in Seattle. However, I am glad you were comfortable in our luxurious two-bedroom suite. Respectfully,",

They have a stop right in front of the hotel! Very convenient, esp. when the free hotel shuttle bus stops running in the evening around 6pm. The staff were all pleasant from the time we came till the end of our stay. The bed was very comfortable w/a feathered pillow top. There is a controlled heating and cooling system in the room. The only prob. w/that is the noise. But it really didn't bother us. Parking does cost money but there is free parking in the back of the hotel. There is meter parking that's free after 6 and free all day Sundays. The free breakfast in the morning was excellent. They offered the usual breakfast foods (home made waffles, eggs, sausage, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruits, etc.etc.).It was a great stay and I would definitely come back!",

Watery eggs, dry (turkey) sausages, extremely dry Canadian bacon and no real bacon! There was cereal, yogurt, waffles different bread products, and strangely, Thai curry soup with rice every morning.

They had a room available and check in was quick. We had a rental car and parking was in the lower level for 23.00 per day.ROOM: Our room was on the 7th floor 7023. There was a kitchen with stove, refrigerator with ice maker, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, dishwasher and stocked with all the utensils. The bedroom was separate with a king bed, bath with tub and shower. Two nice flat screen TV's with cable in the living room and bedroom. The couch in the living room converted to a bed. The patio had the view of a side street and had no chairs. There were lake view rooms at additional cost. I called the front desk and asked for chairs and they were brought up promptly. The room had WIFI internet and worked great. The AC worked great. Everything in the room was very clean. Housekeeping was excellent.BREAKFAST BUFFET: Included with your room was an awesome hot breakfast buffet from 6:00 am to 9:00 am in the main lobby. They served scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, fruits, waffles, breads, doughnuts, juices, cereal. There were 3 newspapers first come first served.LOCATION: This hotel is in a great location. There were many restaurants within walking distance. Across the street there is a marina and a sea plane company where you could take a ride to see the area or take one of their scheduled flights to Canada. Mass transit to downtown Seattle is right in front of the hotel.FITNESS CENTER AND POOL: There is a small Fitness Center which had treadmills, elliptical, bike, weight machines, and dumbbells. You will find a small pool next to the Fitness Center with Men's and Women's locker rooms. Both are located on the 3rd floor.HOTEL: All employees were very friendly and helpful. The hotel lobby is an atrium with a waterfall. Everything was very clean inside and out. The front desk has a computer you can access your airlines website and print out your boarding passes.THINGS TO DO: Visit the Pike Street Market in downtown Seattle. Go to a Seattle Mariners game at Safeco Field. WEATHER: The weather was absolutely fabulous. Three days without a cloud in the sky. Record breaking temperatures in the 90's. SUMMARY: The Residence Inn Seattle Lake Union is an excellent hotel. We will certainly stay here when we return to Seattle. Email me at blueeyes1952yahoo.com if you have any questions.",

Since there were four of us we picked the Residence Inn for its location and room size. After a long cross-country flight and cross-city taxi ride, we arrived at the hotel after midnight. Although I had been told previously that the hotel was completely booked, we were immediately offered an upgrade to a larger, more accommodating room, which I accepted. My fault - I just assumed that the offer was at the same price I had previously agreed to pay for the original room since I was not informed otherwise. It was not. An email alert received after we were in the room let me know exactly how much my card had been charged,which was quite a bit more than the reserved room. Not the hotel's fault I was tired and should have been more attentive, but at that point it didn't matter. We appreciated the larger room, especially the second bedroom.The included breakfasts were excellent, the front desk personnel were extremely efficient in helping to book the two escorted tours we took, and, since we were expecting to get some exercise, the location of the hotel allowed us to walk to the Space Needle and upper downtown areas without too much complaining from the teenager. The exercise room and the indoor pool were both used. The close proximity of the REI flagship store (an easy walk) was a plus.We ate at four of the restaurants within walking distance of the hotel (two on the lake) and enjoyed an after dinner walk around Lake Union just across the street. The room was great, the extra space was definitely a plus, and the location was convenient. Overall, a good experience.Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn for your visit to Seattle. We are delighted that you enjoyed yourselves!",

Hotel has a pool, gym and a game room, although we found the pool to be a bit small and somewhat murky. The breakfast is continental and very basic (like you would find in most other hotels) and the WiFi, although free, was quite slow.Dining: There are a few restaurant across the street, near the bay, they are good for a quick bite but I did not find them to be very impressive. You can get to the business district via short walk and they have more choices.Overall I would recommend the stay if the price is right. I would entitle this hotel with top marks is they had something better than average like the pool, wifi or restaurant. It just falls slightly short of the 5* mark.Thank you for sharing your feedback about your stay in Seattle.

                "text": "We just returned from a 3 night stay and were very pleased with the customer service. The guest reception (Mon-Wed) were fantastic for our family. Great items that could substitute for a light dinner. Breakfast was also great for our family although my husband was a bit tired of the same menu by the 3rd day. Distance to the Seattle Center were very nearby, especially helpful if you are taking one of the ferries. Staff and front reception were very accommodating and thoughtful. They noticed we were checking in with our younger children and were able to find us a room very near the pool. Now that's hospitality! A note to pet owners - they allow pets! We would definitely stay here again! Just a note: parking is 19/day and pretty standard along Seattle Center. You have to pay for parking everywhere you go. Pool area is rather tight with an awkward lay out and very little seating. Whirlpool was being renovated and not working while we were there. They also had a sauna and small kiddie pool.",

We had a two bedroom two bathroom suite my wife and I shared with her two sisters. The rooms were seperated by a Kitchen and living room area. The hotel was extremely clean and the staff was exceptional. We had never been to Seattle before and Mary, Susanne and Eric were always there to help us with our sightseeing questions and needs. The fist day we walked to the space needle and then took the monorail to downtown Seattle and Pike's Market. We then took the streetcar back to the hotel. We had a reservation at another hotel post cruise, but cancelled it and went back to the Residence Inn. They have a great breakfast in the morning, free Wi-fi in the rooms, and it is right out the door from Lake Union, great restaurants and the marina. The hotel rates were reasonable and we just can't say enough about the city, hotel and the staff. We'll be back!",

The room also had a kitchen with a small table. This area was not very big but we were not bothered by this as we were out all day. The hotel has a complimentary buffet breakfast that was great a good variety. It also had an inside heated pool but we didn't get the chance to use it. The hotel also had a laundry which was good, as it saved us from trying to find a laundry mat. Our room was not facing the lake and we didn't have any views but it was quiet which is what really mattered to us. We also had a hire car which we had to pay for parking. We walked from this hotel to the Seattle Space Needle and then caught the Monorail downtown. There was also a tram/bus outside the hotel that took you downtown. Overall we liked this hotel and thought everything was quite accessible from here.",

Free breakfast. Had an issue with the parking, below is part of my email to Marriott. I initially bid on a one night stay, after successfully winning the bid I was prompted to extend my stay. I was happy to do so after reviewing the location of the hotel, the free breakfast and most importantly the free parking. Because of the two separate reservations, I had to re-check in again for the second night, no big deal. When checking in for the second night I was asked if we had a car with us, which we did. We were informed of the 23 dollar parking fee. I mentioned to the front desk clerk, that it might be on file that I have an email from my successful bid that clearly states the parking was free. (We had the same issue the first night of check in, but I just showed my email and the free parking was granted) The front desk manager Jill took note of the situation and jumped in. Saying very loudly, No, NO, NO! You Priceline People do NOT get free parking, never! It was a little embarrassing to us, that we were being referred to, actually we were being yelled at for using Priceline for our reservation. We mentioned the free parking was one of our main reasons for extending our stay for two nights. Again we were reminded that us Priceline People do not ever get free parking . I asked if I should run up and get my phone (which had the email indicating free parking) to which Jill replied at a much louder voice than was required (since I was right in front of her) yeah, but it wont do you any good, Priceline People never ever get free parking. And then something to the effect of Id like to see this email. As I walked away to get my phone and my wife waited nearby, Jill continued to rant about the situation right in front of my wife as if she wasnt standing there. This was getting very embarrassing for the both of us as there were lots of customers around because the morning breakfast was just wrapping up. I returned with my iPhone, showed the email, free parking was granted, although not without a few extra snarky comments from Jill. No apology, no thanks for being patient, no sorry for the confusion, nothing. Also, worth noting that we were put into a room without a balcony, not sure if that was further punishment for using Priceline. It clearly indicates online that all rooms have a private balcony. If your hotel wants to treat Priceline guest different than other guests, you should probably not make your hotel available to be booked through Priceline.Dear sir,I am very sorry that your experience at the Residence Inn Seattle Lake Union was not to your expectations. I have contacted Priceline to ensure that our information is correct for future travelers. Though it doesn't appear that you were treated this way, I'd like to assure you that guests who book through Priceline can expect the same level of guest service that we pride ourselves on providing to all of our guests. I would like to have the opportunity to speak with you directly about your experience and anything I can do to make it right for you. You can contact me at (206) 624-6000.Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback so that we can continue to improve in the future.Carl AntonGeneral ManagerResidence Inn by Marriott - Seattle Lake Union",

                "text": "First -- a little background. We decided this summer to do a 10-day driving vacation, starting in Seattle, then Vancouver, Banff, Glacier National Park, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, Jackson Hole, and ending in Salt Lake City. As the date for our flight to Seattle drew closer and closer, my work deadlines were keeping me from making reservations. Finally -- with about a week to go -- I turned to tripadvisor.com, read the top hotel reviews for our key stops, then made my reservations. As those of you with more than four in your family (we have five: my wife and me, plus two teenagers and a nine year old) know, it can be a real challenge finding suitable accommodations that don't leave someone sleeping on a sofa or on the floor. Almost without exception, our hotels were real winners, with a couple real gems, and just one clunker. And no one had to sleep on the floor.As it turned out, the Residence Inn Seattle/Lake Union was a very nice place to start our vacation. The location was good -- close to Interstate 5, but close to downtown Seattle as well. It was easy to grab a cab downtown (didn't want to hassle finding a place to park our rental car). We had a spacious and clean 2-bedroom suite on a high floor. Nice and quiet -- just the way I like it. Only negatives were that we had a south-facing room -- over an industrial building and away from Lake Union (would have enjoyed a lake view much better) -- and the hotel's parking lot was hard to get in and out of with our humongous GMC Yukon XL rental car, and hard to find spaces later in the day (we ended up parking on the street because all the spaces were filled). Overall, however, a good experience -- four out of five stars.",

After two days of living here, I could have stayed on. I loved the location, there is a Starbucks and CVS at a walkable distance - just across from the hotel. The rooms are clean, and big sized. It's structured like a suite, so you get some living room space too. The kitchen is well equipped. It's well connected, they have a complimentary wi if service and the internet speed is good. The only downside being that the area is not considered very safe, but I didn't encounter any issues.The breakfast is very average, No in-house restaurant. I don't like their wash rooms, very small and the products are very very average - I would recommend to carry your own shampoo, body wash etc along. The staff is friendly and helpful.Thank you for your review and I am glad you enjoyed our spacious rooms.

I attempted to call the front desk several times but no one had answered. I sent my daughter down to ask for towels since our room was not made. My daughter then called me and said they have no towels. I told her to go back to the front desk and put me on the phone since their phones are still busy. The front desk told me that they don't make up the rooms on the weekends, which is not what was advertised on the tent card in my room, and that the hotel was completely out of towels. I told her I have 4 people in here that need to shower when will towels be available. She stated at 9 the next day when housekeep is in. I told her we need to shower then she FINALLY offered hand towels. Needless to say I have never been to a hotel where they don't clean my room and ran out of towels!! I will never ever stay here again!",

Instead of fixing them, they have placed a lot of small fridges in the room as well, but not all, so if you need a fridge check to see if it works after checking into your room.

Amenities included a hairdryer, an alarm clock and a CD player with music CDs provided, plus free wifi. The walls are very thick, so you don't hear anything from next door rooms. Everything was clean. The bathroom was very clean, white/grey marble, with strong shower. I never had any conflict with using the bathroom. The public rooms are limited and a little worn, but perfectly adequate. I don't know how the breakfast was as I didn't avail myself of it. The reception was basic and not overly friendly, but I only saw one person ever. The rest of the time I came and went without any sense that anyone worked there or manned the entrance, since you are given an entrance code upon check in.

What will keep me coming back is the absolutely wonderful service I received from the front desk and the restaurant staff, way beyond the call of duty and very graciously offered. And also, honestly, the scrumptious food coming from the kitchen. The chef is awesome! I had been told to stay at The Pearl by a colleague who said that the rooms are just OK but the bar scene and dinners are non-pareil. He was right!Thank you very much for the kind review.

Love all the plugs for laptop and cell phone. Alarm clock radio even plugged into my iPhone and acted as a speaker.There's an outdoor pool and jacuzzi too.

The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.",

I asked from the receptionist(her) to change our room but she said Sorry, its during the spring break and we are fully booked. I really liked the design of their lobby and their restaurant.The breakfast was just okey, some of their personnel were really friendly and I can understand having bad neighbors at any hotel is not really the hotel fault, anyway we definitely never go back to this hotel again.Dear Guest,Thanks for your comments. I am glad you like the design of our lobby and restaurant. Im sorry that your otherwise pleasant stay here was marred by actions by other guests.

As a small town girl, I was SO Glad we were on a tour our driver was top notch! In Michigan we have two seasons, winter construction. Well In Texas they have one... Construction with weather breaks. But the Best Western PLUS Dallas Hotel lived up to its name. We were whisked up to our clean quiet room. Our King bed was well made, comfortable with Good pillows (sometimes we find the puffy rocks that give you a crick in the neck - not here) The room was clean all the amenities were there. We offloaded ourselves, tidied up in our room headed out to see Dallas Fort Worth to go to Billy Bob's. But more about that later.We found the two nights we stayed with the BW crew to be comfortable, positive experiences. We found the two breakfasts we ate there to be outstanding. If it wasn't on the Breakfast bar, you didn't need it. The breakfast room was kept clean the buffet well stocked. They worked! There were two other tour groups there when we were. We all descended on the food like locusts. But the staff was up to it. a dish began to look near empty zoom it was refilled with fresh hot replacements. The people who work in housekeeping deserve a shout out! They do a job to be proud of. Being on LBJ Freeway, it was pretty much easy on off... if you are a nascar driver. but then I already told you I'm a traffic coward, didn't IThank you so much for your very kind comments!!!I am glad you have a wonderful experience both here at the Best Western Plus and in Dallas. Come back and visit us next time you are in the area!Warm Wishes,John Bright HarrisAssistant General ManagerBest Western Plus Dallas Hotel Conference Center",

The rooms are MUCH smaller than you think they are going to be and (I know it's weird to mention this, but) the self cleaning toilet was loud and random. 2 The lounge which looks ah-mazing online LOOKS ah-mazing in person, but the hours are inconsistent. Okay, now for the pluses: The check in process and people at the front desk were wonderful! Not to mention the concierge, with whom we steadily checked in, were (there were multiples) VERY helpful. Overall, my husband said he would definitely stay here again, but I'm not 100 sure.Hi Sheryl B,What a great review. We always appreciate specific comments like the ones you left for us, and we have taken note! I'm so glad you found our front desk and concierge staff to be helpful, and enjoyed the hotel over all.

Sea World, the Zoo, the beaches, etc all within 15 minutes.The motel is right off the freeway and while you could hear some freeway noise it wasn't too bad. The motel room was extremely clean. The housekeeping staff here works extra hard to keep the rooms maintained well. The biggest issue of the room was that it was small think bedroom size small. It fits 2 Queen beds and a little night stand, but there isn't any room to walk around the beds. There is a small 3 drawer dresser and a little table and chair. The bathroom is small to the point that you bump the door as you are turning around. However, I would rather have a small clean room than a large dirty one. If you have mobility issues then know that this hotel needs to improve on a few things. One is that they have uneven sidewalks that are not painted or highlighted in anyway so you may be walking and there is a slope that causes a misstep. For someone with mobility issues this could lead to a fall or accident. The other issue is there are no handle rails for the walkway between the office and the pool. So you have to use the wall to steady yourself as you are going up/down those stairs. Breakfast consists of waffles, bagels, muffins, bread/toast, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs and cereals. The dining room can only seat about 20 people so that can be tricky. It appears SDSU is 1 stop to the east of this location with easy freeway access. About a block up the road (north) on Waring there are some convenience stores, restaurants and a little grocery store.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We understand your concerns and I have forwarded your feedback with the management team regarding your concerns. Again, thank your review and hope to see you again soon.",

                "text": "My family and I stayed at this place based on the good reviews from here. We normally stay at Holiday Inn Express because they are very consistent wherever you stay, but I wanted to save a few bucks. This stay was ok, but not as good as some of the reviews would lead you to think. The place is not as clean as some reviews indicate. While the beds appeared to be clean and the bathroom was fairly clean (though extremely small), the carpets were filthy, so much I didn't want to walk around with my shoes off at all (I even had concerns about walking with my shoes ON, jk). Imagine large blackened wear spots right down the middle of the carpet, from the door to the bathroom. In addition, there was a gaping space around the door which let all kinds of noise inside, which wouldn't be a huge problem if the room wasn't right next to the freeway. So, we had to deal with unnecessary freeway noise the entire time. At the bottom of the door was a space about 1/2 an inch. We had to place a rolled up towel there to keep light out, but nothing would stop the sound. My wife didn't seem to mind the noise and said it was like white noise to help her sleep better. I was bothered because it should have been obvious to whoever installed the door and could be remedied with a cheap seal from Home Depot. The location seemed ok, no more dangerous than other parts of San Diego. Parking was ample. The staff were pretty friendly. The breakfast was decent, better than some other hotels, not much selection though. Also, the area where breakfast was served only has two tables to sit at. The Wi-fi was fast enough for Netflix/Hulu, though the TV was pretty small. The clock radio gave off random noises that could not be controlled. It would randomly turn on and play static, not matter what you did to it. Also, I noticed that the smoke alarm was not turned on. I climbed up on the bed to take a look and I was right, it wasn't even connected. The A/C did work well and was pretty quiet.The room itself was pretty small for a double queen, as many other reviews state. Overall, I give the room a 2 out of 5, but the establishment a 3 out of 5 since some of the problems I experienced may have only been with my room (e.g. dirty carpet, gap in door, broken clock radio). This is a decent place if you are overly concerned about the price. However, my next stay I will likely just spend a few extra bucks and stay at a better hotel, like Holiday Inn Express.Hi pcaz79,Thank you for your comments about your recent stay. I am glad to hear any suggestions to make the room quality and overall experience from our guests. For the noise coming in the room, we have installed wither strips on the door frame. However, like you mentioned, there may be improvements to sealing the outside noise by installing another seal at the bottom of the door.I am glad to hear you liked the breakfast even though the breakfast area is small. We do suggest that guests take their breakfast to the pool area and enjoy it at the tables. We have umbrellas attached to the tables so you can enjoy your breakfast in the shade!We hope to see you again at our property and will take into account your suggestion!Pratik ShahGeneral Manager",

This hotel definitely fit that bill.This property is easily seen from I8, but navigating to the actual hotel is a little bit of a challenge. The road sign is by a tree and is better seen coming from the opposite direction from the freeway offramp. We ended up taking a quick tour while looking for a good place to turn around.Upon our arrival, the front desk clerk was assisting another guest. While the wait was not very excessive, the clerk was apologetic for the inconvenience. He did an excellent job of telling us everything that we needed to know in order to maximize our stay.The rooms are small, but they feel new and comfortable. We found nothing that did not work as it was supposed to work, and the room was very clean when we arrived. The biggest challenge was that there is some sort of fog horn noise that can be heard throughout the night. I wondered if we were near to the trolley line or if it was a mechanical issue.The breakfast was nice, with waffles, muffins, and some other options available to guests.Overall, I would stay here again as long as it was the same type of stay - where I am not looking to be in the room for too long. Plenty of space and comfort for one night - but I'm not sure I would be pleased to stay here for much longer.Hi Clint A,Thank you for your review. We are located two turns off the freeway and it is difficult for some to find. I am glad that you were able to get to our location! We do offer other larger room types, such as the Non Smoking King Suite, that may be more suitable for a longer stay.Overall, It is good to hear we were able to provide you with a enjoyable stay. We hope to see you again soon!",

Everything worked fine. The staff was very cordial and cheerful, and when I called to make reservations, Hina was very nice and extremely helpful. The maintenance man was very nice and always had a wonderful smile. The housekeepers and he all seemed to get along very well, we could hear them laughing and enjoying each other's company. The office staff were great also.The only thing that was a bit annoying was that the showers have to run at a fast speed to get any water, and really fast to get warm water. The flow couldn't be adjusted. That was the only thing that bothers us. The towels were nice and soft and clean, the beds were always fresh and clean, the whole area was very pretty. There are hills and canyons all around and there was even a creek behind it and lots of trees. There was never a problem getting a parking spot even if we came back late. It's close to the trolley station, but not a comfortable walk. We drove to it and parked. We did that in order to walk around downtown and by the bay. I would recommend this motel to anyone who wants a quiet, nice and friendly motel. It's also very close to a beautiful Catholic Church, St. Therese, which is at 6016 Camino Rico. Thank you for your review. My staff and I are happy to see you enjoyed your stay. They are very high spirited and bring a lot of their personality to the overall experience of the hotel. Even with all your positive comments, I would still like to work on areas that did not meet your expectations. I will look into how we can adjust the water pressure or shower heads to provide a more comfortable stay for our guests. Thanks again for choosing us and we hope to see you again soon!",

The breakfast was good, would of been nice to have some eggs and a meat but you get to make your own waffles, they have fresh fruit, milk, juice, cereal, bagels among other things so by far better than a regular old continental breakfast! The room was great, could not have been any cleaner if we were the first persons to stay there and the fact that it was recently remodeled shows. We were there for my sons Marine graduation and his Uncle stayed at a more expensive hotel by the bay and had to change rooms 3 times then ended up changing hotels all together and still didn't get one with a working A/C. He got no fridge or microwave with his room either, that was an extra cost, my room came with both at no extra cost along with a coffee pot, hair drier and iron. The new A/C in this room kept it really cold in the room just like we like it. The bathtub was so clean with the new tile and tub it didn't even have a water stain anywhere. Had 2 queen beds that are almost as comfortable as my double pillow top at home! Nice soft fluffy pillows! The only bad thing we could say about our whole 4 day stay there was the pool is very small, but worse than that is the fact that it is either not heated or they had not turned it on yet, so the water was too chilly to swim. But I can live with that for the extra comfort of the stay. Also the interstate was not too far from my room but I heard nothing over the steady hum of my A/C. The free WiFi worked good, not real fast but reliable, and the parking lot was a tight fit the free parking was a added bonus considering some hotels in San Diego charge up to 38 a night to park in their lot! Would stay there again any time! Thanks for making our stay so comfortable!!!",

We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment.",

Since you last stayed, we have made some adjustments to our wi-fi to improve the quality throughout the hotel. We have also added better instructions to help guests connect to the internet. With the broad range of mobile devices and tablets, there are some people that encounter connectivity issues. Our hotel is dedicated to make sure every guest can connect to the internet and utilize what they have paid for. Thank you for bringing this to our attention!",

The rooms were nice, but a bit on the small side. The location was good, nothing in walking distance though. We didn't get a chance to have breakfast, so no review on that. Overall a nice place to stay at a decent price and in a good location.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to write a review. I'm glad you chose Rodeway Inn near Qualcomm Stadium and hope to see you again soon the next time you're in San Diego.",

                "text": "Overall, stay here if you are paying 65 or less...else keep looking..definitely not worth a penny more.Stayed the weekend of Feb 13th and due to the high demand for rooms that weekend, this Rodeway Inn was charging 150/night (including taxes, etc)...a complete ripoff. I used priceline and will ensure to pick a higher category of hotels next time around, especially since 150 is insane to charge for this property no matter what supply/demand looks like. First of all, we were given a room on the side of the highway. This is completely fine if you keep the a/c on because that will drown out some of the noise. However, when we walked in the room, it smelled (stale smoke). We immediately called the front desk and asked for another room or to come and spray something. They said there are no rooms available and that they have no febreeze. You'd think that if you're doubling the hotel price for a particular weekend, you would step up service at least a bit. We received no follow up call from the manager the next day nor did the front desk staff attempt to spray anything to remove the foul odor. We next walked into the bathroom and noticed that the towel was stained with dirt. The good thing was that there were extra towels but I don't get what kind of quality control exists at the hotel if you cannot ensure clean towels. Further, the tv was horrible. They list all these channels on their guide however, they subscribe to none of them. Why false advertise to your customers.Again, the price we were charged for this hotel was obscene, especially when a real hotel was charging 20 - 30 more. I have nobody to blame but myself for booking this hotel however the review stands given the fact that I did not receive the services I paid for.",

                "text": "I stayed at the Rodeway Inn for 5 nights as part of a work-related trip to San Diego. Here are my pros, cons, and quirks of my stay.Pros:- Value: I paid 270.00 for 5 nights, including taxes (I also had a 15 off travelocity coupon)- Comfortable room: beds was cozy, pillows were soft- Quiet: It's in a quiet neighborhood, and I was not bothered at all during my stay- Clean: No stains!- Remodeled with a modern touch: flat screen TV, fridge, microwave, hair-drier- Breakfast: it was so-so, consisted of waffles, pastries, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, juice, coffee. Not exactly great but I was filled up every day- A/C was wonderful- WiFi was free, reliableCons: - Distance -- Kind of far from prime locations: 15 mns from beach, 10 mns to downtown, 10 mns to Rady Children's Hospital, 20 mns to LaJolla. You can probably get closer to these locations for equal price. If you stay here, you will need a car rental- No restaurant or gas station is within walking distance- Staff could be more friendly: you need to walk past the friend desk to get to the breakfast bar, and despite making eye contact, the desk clerk didn't say hi.- 50 deposit: When you check in, you are required to swipe a credit card and sign a receipt for a 50 deposit, which I was told would be credited to my account 5-10 days after I check out. Most businesses just keep a card on file, and in 2013, that is preferable. - No elevators Quirks:- The TV in my room was such that I could also watch it in my shower (I really liked that!)- TV remote had no cover over the batteriesOverall: I would stay again, however if I wanted a beach vacation, I would try to find somewhere closer.",

Room was not antiseptic, but certainly clean enough. Bathroom tiny but the room itself was fine with a fridge and microwave. Had some issues with keys not working and the pool is bathtub size so don't get your hopes up. Breakfast was about what one would expect and the breakfast area is small but it was never crowded. If you want a clean quiet room at a bargain price, this place fits the bill but don't expect too much. Thank you Bruce for your feedback. Please accept my sincere apologies for the experience you encountered during your stay and for we failed to meet your expectations.

I did contact Hotels.com and they resent my reservation and the hotel upgraded me to suite for the inconvenience. There was no apology from the hotel which I thought would have been appropriate. My hotel key kept getting deactivated because my cell phone would get too close to it so that was a hassle, having to take it to the front desk to get activated.

We are an older couple who stayed Feb 11-17th 2018 (Mardi Gras Week) at this very quiet, very classic hotel. The Staff is kind, generous and top notch! We booked a King Suite bed comfortable, continental breakfast delivered to your room every morning walking distance to the French Quarter, the Esplanade district. Great to catch the trolleys (green line - St Charles) via Poydras and (red line - via Canal) to take you to any district. A day pass is 3 USA (can't beat that). Great Staff around the clock all week always making sure your taken care of properly. The Chophouse (Steak Seafood) is right next door if you want an elegant dinner. The French Quarter has everything from a diner type food to elegant cuisine. The food in New Orleans is phenomenal. If you like the nightlife there is plenty to choose from in the French Quarter. Arts/Antique/History walk down Royal Street. A must try/see is Cafe du Monde, Cafe Beignet. The tourist shoppes are in abundance - for best price on typical tourist t-shirts memorabilia, I recommend The French Market! For something extra special, Royal Street. If your thinking of attending the Mardi Gras in 2019, I suggest you prepare for the biggest, loudest, fun filled, crazy, Happy event ever! Its a huge colourful Circus. There is a gazillion people filling the streets so if crowds are not your thing don't go during Mardi Gras! Go the week after when it has calmed down and more relaxed. We booked the Creole Queen River Boat with meal and it was well worth it! It is located in the Esplanade area within walking distance of the St. James Hotel. The Garden District is stunning - the Magnolia trees were in bloom. Lots of nice shoppes, you will definitely want to have lunch and/or grab some sweets from Sucre. Transfer from the Airport to your hotel can be pricey so I highly recommend you take the Flat Rate 36 USA for 2 people). The taxis will try to tell you there is no flat rate but there is. The service is located when you come out of the terminal on your right hand side. Another must see is the Louis Armstrong Park North of the French Quarter on N. Rampart. Very Memorable New Orleans Mardi Gras Vacation. It should be on your bucket list in the future..... Check out the St. James Hotel for a perfect vacation.Thank you for taking the time to write such a comprehensive review!

The location is perfect only three blocks from the French Quarter and a short streetcar ride to the Garden District. The staff is phenomenal! Danielle, Amy, and Tori are the definition of southern hospitality! They were so knowledgeable of the area and gave us great recommendations on where to eat, drink, and where to enjoy a taste of the local perspective. The room was fantastic! We were upgraded to a suite at check-in, and it was definitely one of the highlights of our stay. Needless to say, we will definitely be staying here from now on and we will be telling all of our friends and family about the St. James!Thank you for the glowing review!

                "text": "Sure - its a boutique hotel with a great location and offers complimentary breakfast. But Ive never encountered issues like this before in all my extensive travels. My check-in and check-out each took over 10 minutes, blaming slow computer issues while I watched guests being served faster at the adjacent desk. At check out, the front desk couldnt even print my folio so I could review and approve the charges. The hotel is made of two buildings if youre in the second building its just across a small patio. However this patio is used as the hotels staging area for extra linens and especially the dumpsters. So every time we needed to reach our room, we had to walk through horrific trash odors. On this trip, I booked two rooms. Upon arrival, The first rooms toilet wouldnt flush which means 1) it didnt flush for the cleaning crew and 2) the cleaning crew did noting to report and repair. When we came back to the room after the repair, toilet water was everywhere all over the floor and the maintenance guy used one of our towels to drag around the floor and left it in the bathroom. GROSS. In the second room, on our first night I pulled down the bedsheets and was appalled to find a lot of food crumbs and hair from the prior occupants. It was quite evident. GROSS. When I called the front desk, the staff informed me that no one else was available to change our bedding. She had a formal response but I could tell shes just going through the motions. So I asked for new sheets to change it myself. I do commend the hotel manager for calling me back the next morning, sounding genuinely concerned, and offering other incentives to rectify the cleanliness issue. But at this point, the hotel staff doesnt reflect the same professionalism or attitude, and I know we wont be returning here.Thank you for your feedback. On behalf of our hotel, please accept my apologies for failing to exceed your expectations regarding the check-in and out process, poor service, and lack of cleanliness. These are things we must work on to ensure we continue to provide an exceptional stay experience for each guest. We appreciate the honest feedback and hope you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations on a future visit.",

                "text": "This is a decent budget hotel (thought not so budget in its price). The room is decent size, the queen bed that I had was comfy, the a/c worked fine, and the room also had a mini fridge and a microwave (I didnt use the latter, so cant testify on its quality). However, I found a few things very irritating. First, the shower. Although the shower-head is decent, you can never know if you would have hot water or not, and the water's temperature changes while you take a shower. It seems that during peak hours, like 7am or 7pm, the hot water will last for 2-3 minutes, and than you will experience 1-2 minutes of cold water, before the hot water resume. But the most diaspointing thing was breakfast - the hotel advertises a free continental breakfast, but reality is slightly different. Every evening you are asked to fill in a form, where you ask when would you like breakfast to be delivered to your door. And than, the following morning, around the time that you ask, give or take 15 min, a person will bring in one pot of look warm, undrinkable, coffee, and one pre-hitted (by microwave) croissant, with a tiny piece of cheap butter and a tiny jar of jam. This is it - that's your breakfast. Every morning I found myself going out and buying breakfast at a cafe. It is not only the taste, or the luck of it, but also the quantity, and the lack of it as well. Plenty of better options around, for the same price.Dear Np-In,Thank you for writing a review about your recent stay with us. We appreciate you mentioning the amenities that you did enjoy such as the queen bed, a/c unit and mini fridge. We genuinely apologize that your water temperature was not consistent and will pass on your issue to our maintenance department so we may investigate the problem. In regards to our free breakfast service, we take pride in our simple offering but only if it is the most superior quality. So again, we apologize that this failed to meet your expectations. We will use your feedback to better our services and hope that next time you visit New Orleans you will give us another chance to wow you.Warm Regards,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",

                "text": "This was our first visit to New Orleans and I wanted to stay in a hotel that represented the architecture the area is known for. I chose St. James based on that as well as some of the reviews I had read. As our trip got closer, I became slightly concerned with some of the reviews I read about cleanliness and other issues. Well, after our stay, I have come to the conclusion that some people just like to complain over stupid stuff. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman and were so impressed with the decor upon entering the hotel. Registration is not a typical high counter, but two desks which put you face to face with very friendly agents. Arielle took care of us and was so friendly, giving us information on the area, highlighting points of interest based on what we wanted to see. We requested a high floor (there are only four) and were placed on the third floor away from the elevator. Our king room was spacious and very clean. We had a corner room (311) which gave us four windows and plenty of natural light. Two of the windows overlooked the courtyard and the other two an alley facing a building. On our bed was the card to fill out for breakfast the next morning. We turned the card into the front desk when we decided to go out and explore a bit before turning in for the night. The next morning our breakfast was delivered to our room at the time we requested with all items we requested, croissants (4), coffee (2) and orange juice (1) on a silver tray with sugar, cream, butter and jams. I have never experienced anything like this and found it to be so nice. This was repeated during our entire stay. Each time we left or came back to the hotel, we were greeted by very friendly people who always asked if we were enjoying our stay or if there was anything they could do to make our stay even more enjoyable. We explored the hotel a bit and loved the decor and architecture in every area. The courtyard was inviting and comfortable. We decided to find the pool and agree with the other reviews that it is not big enough to swim in, but we didn't go there for that and appreciated the atmosphere the area offered. My personal recommendation would be to turn it into an active fountain instead of a pool. Oh, the reviews that mention leaving the room, coming back in the afternoon to an unmade bed and room are simply not true. We left our room every morning by 10:30 and returned in the late afternoon (3:30) to drop stuff off and always found our room to be remade and just as clean as the first time we entered. This hotel is centrally located to everything and off the main areas making sleeping easier away from all the Bourbon Street noise and activity. Mind you, there is noise, but it is city noise which you would get in any city hotel such as fire trucks making runs or ambulance runs. Nothing I haven't experienced in New York or Boston. You have to expect you will hear some city noise when staying in a city! If I ever return, I will most definitely stay at the St. James Hotel.",

They both made our trip the best experience. I highly recommend this hotel!",

We are ecstatic that you had a great stay and loved the charm of our historic building. We appreciate your understanding that parking in the Central Business District is limited which is why we provide valet parking.

They bring coffee, juice and croissants to your room every morning and they are always so fresh and tasty. Location is great, we found it to be very central to everywhere we wanted to go. Only downside is that the pool is a tiny pond-like structure that you can't really swim in and the pool area is usually shaded by the building shadows. (We used bookit.com both times and were pleased with the value but are disappointed to see it is no longer affiliated with that site).We will definitely be staying here every time we visit NOLA!",

The breakfast is included BUT only 1 croissant,1 coffee and 1 glass of OJ PER person. Room was clean and good amount of space, I was on the 4 floor. Friendly courteous and helpful staff. The only complaint I have is the bathroom, water pressure was EXTREMELY low and our sink was not working when we arrived, we waited 20 hours for the sink to be fixed. I know sometimes at hotels water pressure is not the best, but the hotel shower water pressure was really low. NoLa is great city to visit with amazing food and sites to visit.Dear Valued Customer,Thank you for sharing your recent experience at the St. James Hotel. We are glad that you appreciated our location, price and courteous staff. In regards to the amount of time it took to fix your sink, there is no excuse for this failure and we are grateful that you brought this to our attention. As mentioned in a previous response, the low water pressure was caused due to a main water line issue with the city. We are confident this issue is resolved. We hope to welcome you back next time you are in New Orleans. King Regards,",

The hotel is older, but its public spaces are beautifully appointed in soothing neutrals and comfortable faux-classic furniture the shady courtyard is perfect for hanging out with friends, wine, and snacks. In our part of the two building complex, our room was small, but clean, andreflective of the age of the buildingboasted doors which had to be muscled shut and floors which creaked and dipped however, thats a heritage building for you and we could see that renovations had been made over the years. The staff, without exception, had to be the most friendly and pleasant group we have ever had the pleasure of meeting. From Miss Michelle at the front desk, to Miss Audrey who delivered our courtesy croissants and coffee every morning, to Pedro at the door, one and all greeted us with smiles and quips, waves and queries about our stay, and in general took excellent care of us from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. It was our first trip to New Orleans and we feel we lucked out in finding the hidden gem that is the St. James on Magazine St.We can't thank you enough for your review! I'm sure your review will be extremely helpful for our future guests. We are glad to hear you enjoyed your stay here - namely the location, public spaces, room, and staff! We take pride in our hotel and the services and amenities we offer here. We can't wait to see you again on your next visit to New Orleans!Kind regards,Duriel HarrisGuest Relations ManagerSt. James Hotel(504) 304-4000",

It's quieter and has some new and old hotels that seem lovely, like the St. James. This appears to be a revitalized historical building. The lobby and courtyards are beautiful. I liked the croissants and coffee/tea/juice delivered to your room every morning. Loved the wood floors and large windows. Ariel at the Front Desk was beyond welcoming and friendly. She represents New Orleans well! My daughter adored her. All the staff was exceptional. If you need something, please ask. And be nice to them. They are human too. The Chop House attached to the hotel is amazing and staff is just as wonderful! Treat yourself to dinner there. I do feel that Housekeeping was a little lacking, but when I mentioned it, my concerns were resolved. It's a unique and lovely hotel.Dear Elizabeth S,Thank you for taking the time to write a review. Thank you for the feedback regarding our service and amenities. Also, our building is restored from the Civil War period as we used to be a hospital for Union soldiers among other things so good eye! We are very pleased that you ventured in the central business district. The city has greatly developed this area in recent years and it has so much to offer! We hope you visit with us again soon!Sincerely,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",

Very convenient location, 2 block walk to the French Quarter. Yes, there were renovations going on, but no noise until 8am. Maybe a problem if you are out partying to 2 am...but I wanted to enjoy the sights, so it was not any inconvenience. The croissant delivered to my door every morning was HUGE, and wonderfully flaky. The staff was helpful with directions and letting me know what areas were safe to walk in. The beds were very comfortable and I slept well each night. The microwave and mini fridge in the room are very handy amenities to have. I am diabetic, and having the fridge/ micro make life much easier when traveling. The worst thing about my trip was a Boil water alert was called (it happens once in a while in this area) but the hotel handed out bottled water to the guests until the area wide situation was resolved. Thank you Ingrid, for making my trip a wonderful memory. I am already planning a trip for next year and will not hesitate to stay at the St. James again.Dear H S,Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us. We are pleased that the staff was helpful and the amenities were able to accommodate your needs. The city-wide boil water alert can be an inconvenience so we appreciate your understanding with our bottled water and mentioning that we handled the situation properly. We are delighted to read that you are planning a trip back to NOLA and the St. James next year!Kind Regards,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",

One feature I especially enjoyed, it was quiet!The hotel has a contract with a local garage service to valet park the cars for 30 over 24 hours. Two hours after our arrival, our car was still parked in front of the hotel. Upon departure, we discovered that all of the money (20) in our change drawer (there were bills included) had been taken. I called the manager on duty to notify of the problem. I was told this is not the first time this has happen. I am sure there are other garage services that would be happy to take on this contract.",

Staff is very nice and helpful,The room is an average room--small and tight but that is normal for New Orleans, Walls are paper thin and the first night of our neighbors screamed and fought and had to call security,Also the door has a 1 gap on the bottom with light and noise pouring in! Used pillows at night to block (not so good)Bed creaks and is hard to get up without waking everyone else .Maid service is TERRIBLE!!! First night coming back to room we were missing all the cups, all the coffees, all the teas, no bathmat, no washrags, and no kleenex.Second night returning to the room at 5 pm---room was not touched--had to call front desk and they said O No the maids were running behind.Maid Mng said they would be over at 6:30 to do room. We left at 6.Came back at 11pm and sure the maid came in and straightened the bed.And that is all they did.......This time there was no cups, no coffee, no tea, no bathmat, and both trashcans were overfilled and not empty and no toilet paper.Again I called down to front desk and requested things brought to my room--front desk clerk asked (testily) what do we need right away (she sounded very put out)Today I will speak with a manager and hopefully all of the other rooms our friends are in are not suffering this poor service and attitude.Dear Richard b,Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay. Let me apologize on behalf of my staff for the housekeeping and front desk clerk issues that you experienced. There is never an excuse to respond to your needs while here at the hotel. Please forgive us as what your experience did not meet your standards or our own. As I reviewed these comments with our staff, I discovered that our Assistant GM has spoken with you and hopefully helped to resolve any issues we could at this point. We have used your experience as a learning tool in order to find ways to make improvements. The service that you received is simply unacceptable. We truly hope you will consider a future stay so that we may provide you with a stay that you deserve.Warm Regards,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",

The front door was closed and there were work crews in the makeshift lobby area during our entire stay. The free breakfast is a single piece of bread and a small glass of orange juice. There is no free breakfast. The hotel is extremely overpriced. The hotel is within decent walking distance of the New Orleans sights. The customer service is non-existent. I booked this hotel through hotels.com after calling to confirm that I could use a third party site and still get a Cruise and Stay discount on cruise terminal parking. The hotel CONFIRMED that I could do this. They also CONFIRMED this when I arrived at check-in. At check out they DENIED that I could have discounted cruise parking and the front desk employee refused to contact a manager or customer service for me. Customer service did not answer my call after 30 minutes.Dear E G,I am terribly sorry to read about the service that you experienced in May of 2016. We are no longer under any construction and I can assure you that this is not typical service for our hotel- especially now. I apologize that you were misinformed about our cruise parking rate as that does need to be booked directly in order to ensure the discount. I am not sure who you are referencing in regards to customer service but there is no excuse for the experience that you had. We do offer a complimentary croissant along with your choice of coffee, a variety of teas or orange juice delivered right to your room. It is our intention for this to be a nice treat before you head out to explore our beautiful city for the day. If you find yourself in New Orleans again, I do hope you stop by to see the difference a year can make. Best,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",

They were booked so I thought I would try this place.Checking in was fine but I noticed most of the other guests were tourists. That's okay if everything flows like it should.Continental breakfast is brought to your room per the order sheet you hang on your door.Monday night I made my selection and indicated it to be brought up between 7 and 7:30. Tuesday morning at promptly 7:30 as I'm walking out the door, the order arrives. I tell the worker I have to leave and to give it to someone else. I have meetings all week at 8:00.Tuesday night, I fill out the card and write on it, if it can't be delivered at 7:00 then don't deliver. Wednesday morning I get a call at 6:45 indicating my breakfast is ready in the courtyard downstairs.Wednesday night I ask the clerk how do I do this for Thursday and she says to just write it on the card for Thursday morning.So I make my selection and write that I will be in the courtyard at 7:00. This morning (Thursday), I go down to the courtyard and nothing. I sit there for 15 minutes with no one in sight. I leave and ask the desk clerk to get my car brought down and ask about breakfast. She knows nothing about it and offers to get some, but I tell her that have to leave.I get back to the room tonight, and there is no selection card...So I go to the desk and ask for one and then mention some of the difficulty with breakfast as I'm 1 out of 3. The male clerk basically stats arguing with me that I should have let them know. Luckily the clerk I spoke with this morning was there and she indicated the I did. The hotel itself is okay. It's old and smells a bit musty, but I don't mind that. The walls are paper thin as I had a virtually in room experience of the amorous exploits of the couple in the next room. I was a bit envious of his stamina....The floor in the room has twice vibrated as though an unbalanced motor is directly below me. Luckily it didn't last long and was only twice.There is dried paint all over the place in the bathroom so maintenance is obviously is sloppy.As indicated there seem to be a lot of foreign travelers here which they seem to cater to.So if you don't have time constraints it's probably an okay hotel, otherwise you might be better off somewhere else.",

No, they gave us a 2nd floor room right over the street the dumpster. Noisy every morning between 3am 6am- except Sunday. But, the room was always clean, plenty of fresh towels bathroom amenities, as well as a fridge, microwave, big screen HD TV with premium channels ( not that we were in the room long enough to watch them, but...). Room was smallish (not as small as NYC basic), but room enough. The courtyard is nothing more than a small alleyway with flowers, shrubs some places to sit. One draw was the coffee croissants delivered to your room - which was nice the first morning, then I had to go downstairs to the coffee station in the lobby to get more cream, then had to be sure to request it the next morning, and the last morning had to ask at the desk for any cream was told very matter-of-factly, I guess we're out ....

It can feel like pulling teeth to get the most basic request fulfilled - a first experience of that kind.Breakfast: Pros - Really, really delicious. Fantastic coffee and delivered right to your room. Worth paying for, but comes free!Cons - It's like pulling teeth to get that breakfast slip and you may get a subpar, put together last minute breakfast. Parking: Pro - Cheaper than other valet services at hotels in NOLA. Takes the stress out of finding parking. Con - No self-park option available. They crashed my car causing a lot of damage. Hotel Value : Pro - Fantastic. Clean beds, reasonable sized rooms, really good location, complementary small breakfast.Con: If you're unlucky you may not get all of these things they promise/advertise, which lowers the value some. Experience:We booked this hotel same day as we were road tripping around the US and decided to stop in NOLA for the weekend. Expedia had a good rate on it, and it had fantastic reviews.Upon checking in the woman at the front desk was busy, a little tired, but friendly. However, her tone noticeably changed when she tried to double check that we wanted a single king bed. As a same sex young married couple, but we're discreet and get that question often. People are just double checking that we prefer that, but we've never had a really negative reaction in any country, city or state we've ever travelled to (even Turkey). This woman became pretty frosty and really...short with us immediately after. I couldn't figure out what I said to cause it, as, like I said, even if people don't like it, they're usually professional and just give us a room. I can't guarantee that THAT was what made this woman take a disliking to us, but we said or did something to get on her bad side quickly and boy did it stick! We got a single queen room on the second floor near to the emergency exit. The room was very spacious, for the price and very clean. Other people have said the beds felt really saggy and worn, but ours was really, really comfortable. The microwave was a really useful addition to the room and a coffee maker is always appreciated. The only weird part was that there was a welcome card sitting on the desk addressed to Mr. And Mrs. Thomas, or something, welcoming them to the hotel and the coffee maker had been used. I guess it was their room originally. Of additional note was our view - of which there was none. More specifically - it was of a brick wall a couple of feet away. We thought nothing of it when first arriving, but later found it to be strange as it has to be the worst view in the hotel. We noticed, same day when housekeeping was still cleaning rooms, or just generally had the doors open (I have no clue why) that not only were a majority of the rooms empty, but they had much better views and were almost double the size of ours. I have no idea why that room was picked for us, but it was.In regards to breakfast, they have a really fantastic set-up when it is fully put into place. You get complimentary fresh croissants and coffee or orange juice delivered to your room at the time of your choosing in the morning (between 6-10, or something similar). When we got up to our room the first time we called asking about the breakfast slip the front desk lady said would be waiting. She answered saying that it was in the drawer. We checked all of them and said it wasn't there. She said again that it was and hung up. Riiiight. We went downstairs when leaving to go to the French Quarter and asked the male desk guy about the breakfast slip and he said it was in the drawer. We said it wasn't, and he said housekeeping would give us one and that they put a new one in every day. Mind you, the stipulation of the complimentary breakfast was that you had to put the slip out by 10pm. Upon returning at midnight there was still no slip. Now, it's not the end of the World if I don't get the croissant, I don't really care, but it's kind of annoying if they offer it. We went back down and asked a different desk lady if we could get a breakfast slip. She replied, oh, of course! and grabbed one from a pile sitting under the desk. I don't fully understand why nobody else would give us one when they were sitting right there. Maybe it really was a housekeeping job. I don't know. So, we got breakfast in the morning, checking that others in our hallway has them still hanging and that they hadn't been collected. About four did, including the room two doors down. In the morning, we got our croissants and coffee only for them to be kinda hard and average coffee pre-made in coffee cups. Honestly, I didn't expect anything different so it was really nice. However, when we put our tray outside I noticed that everyone else (the other 4) had carafe looking coffee pots and slightly different plate/tray set up. Weird. Whatever. We get back after sightseeing to find we don't have a breakfast slip. Again. And our used coffee (which was used before we got there) still hasn't been replaced. We call down and speak to the initial lady who checked us in. She got a little angry and said housekeeping leaves the breakfast slips, that it's in the drawer and said we would have to order coffee on our breakfast slip they don't do room service. I told her I was misunderstood, we just wanted housekeeping to replace our coffee for the coffee maker, but then she asked why we needed coffee in the room if we just ordered it on the slip for breakfast. I said I would really appreciate having the option to make it at other times. Either way she told me shed send housekeeping and didn't. Later, before dinner, I realised I didn't grab my bag with my stomach medication when checking in the previous night. We went downstairs and asked the woman, who was the one that checked us in and already hung up on us twice, if we could have valet grab our car. She said no, they would only be able to go into our car and grab it. I said okay, but that it might be tough to find. I offered to walk to the lot and she said this was not permitted. She then pulled out a list with a bunch of crossed out customer requests on top, and added us to the other two new requests on the bottom. I knew it was busy and gave it about 40 minutes. Still nothing. My wife called down and asked if they could also grab her shoes while they were there, and if we could get that coffee for our coffee maker. Spathe same desk lady said yes. We waited another hour, and another hour after that. We waited a total of three hours for valet to bring my stomach medication so I could have dinner. At this point it was 9:30pm. We went back downstairs and the same desk lady declared, with slightly feigned surprise, 'oh, you haven't received your items.' I said no, that we were probably still on her list because she hadn't called about them arriving. She looked at the list, of which there were others listed below us, and everything was crossed out but ours. She said shed take care of it. Suddenly, 10 minutes later, they pulled the vehicle up, something she said was impossible before. I got my pills, gave the keys back and (stupidly) didn't tip because I was grumpy waiting for my car for 3 hours. On the way back up to the room my wife spotted a random housekeeping cart near the elevator and nabbed a breakfast slip, as we still didn't get one. She just got tired of asking and calling 4 times a day.Our breakfast, the next morning, was completely different from the day before. Delicious, fresh croissants. A metal carafe of fantastic coffee. Fresh pressed orange juice. It was a night and day difference from the day before. It was so good I would have actually paid extra for it! We checked out Monday morning after a really great weekend spent in the French quarter, and sightseeing. We waited, again, an unusually long time for the valet (over an hour) before a young 17/18yr old kid delivered it to us. The car had been crashed into a pole and had a busted up fender and broken trunk.The rest is overly boring detail involving the police, having to stay an extra night in New Orleans, and being left with 3k worth of damage.We remained shockingly polite throughout it, though I have no idea why. I guess I couldn't blame the young kid, he didn't do it and it was terrible his boss sent him instead of coming himself. I couldn't be angry at the desk girl, someone I hadn't even seen before she didn't do it either. I asked if my valet fee could be refunded, as nobody had offered yet. She said said and was trying to be very help, only to double charge us, instead of refunding it (we would find out the next day). We ended up having to drive cross-country with a broken trunk and body damage to my vehicle in order to get back home quickly. The rest of our vacation plans had to be cancelled and the weekend stay racked up a tab of nearly 3500, between the hotel, double charged valet and vehicle repairs. I will give credit to the manager, whom was very cooperative and, as I pretty much cried to her in frustration, made sure our stay and valet were refunded, and vehicle repairs covered. I've got a really biased review, and there were a lot of things that were problematic with the hotel, even before the crash. I understand that sometimes you have bad luck and a bad experience, which I normally totally understand. And, despite all this, I MIGHT still consider staying here or recommending others if they got their act together (but not valet, obviously). The valet isn't the hotel (but it is their only parking option). They were really exceptional at times, but really difficult at others. The location is great, the price really competitive, but there was a serious undertone of homophobia (the first time in my life I've ever experienced that) from one particular desk lady, combined with general incompetence from either housekeeping or the desk people.Dear Iselin,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a thorough review. I appreciate you detailing the good experiences as well as the bad. Here at the St. James, we have zero tolerance for homophobia. The city of New Orleans and the St. James prides itself on welcoming all walks of life with open arms so I am very disappointed that his was this experience that you had. I sincerely apologize for the lack of consistency with the service during your stay and can't thank you enough for reporting all of your issues. As you mentioned in your review, we did have a brief encounter regarding the damages to your car by our valet. I would like to apologize again for this inconvenience. Since your stay, I have had a meeting with our valet company about how these issues should be handled in the future should they arise. Once again, I appreciate your feedback and I hope if you are ever find yourself back in New Orleans you will give us another chance to provide you with the supreme customer service I know that we are capable of. Please contact me directly. Warm Regards",

Room was not good the bathroom was old and poorly maintained, water pressure very bad and shower not that hot, power points came away from the wall when removing dryer etc. The floor above us was very noisy and we could hear footsteps all night , very loud. Room included croissants for breakfast that we're okay but coffee was only warm . Our room also had a safe that didn't work which is a huge pain. We had to drop valuables at the front desk ever time we went out... The phone in our room also continuously flashed a red message light which is actually quite bright at night... We were told it was faulty ( like the safe) . We would think there are better hotels available. We went to bourbon st on Christmas night and found it to be fine .... Pretty quiet but we left by 9 , so can't comment on excessive drinkers etc. it was quiet for obvious reasons. Also went to the aquarium which was worth the visit.Dear Mooseygoosey,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at St. James Hotel, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member.Allow me to apologize on behalf of our hotel for failing to meet your expectations regarding the maintenance of your room on your recent visit.

Her staff (Christy, asst. GM)assured us on Tuesday and Wednesday that they would honor a gift certificate for one nights stay this weekend and Christy would call us back on Thursday with a confirmation because she didnt know how to enter the gift certificate into the computer. No phone call was received on Thursday so we call today. After 3 phone calls, we finally speak to the GM -Jennifer, who said they could not honor the gift certificate bc no rooms were available! This is a BOLD FACED LIE!! There are rooms available according to their website! Do not do business with this joke of a hotel! Customer service is terrible!! The staff is uneducated and clearly lacks customer service knowledge.Dear palmers1800,As I have mentioned on the many other reviews that you have written, I do apologize that we were not able to accommodate your gift certificate this past weekend. Gift certificates are donated as a courtesy to many charitable events that are important to the St. James Hotel family. On the gift certificates, we do specify that they can not be used over special event periods and are for standard rooms. Unfortunately, this past weekend was a special event and we only had 1 room available at the time we spoke which was our King Suite. I do require all gift certificates to be approved through me so I sincerely apologize if you received the incorrect information through our front desk staff. Christie, Assistant GM, began her career at the St. James only a few weeks ago and was not yet familiar with our policies and procedures regarding gift certificates. We would be more than happy to accommodate you in future. Please reach out to me directly at the below direct line. I do hope to hear from you so that we are able to show you the level of customer service that I know the St. James staff is capable or providing. Again, I apologize for any miscommunication and I look forward to hearing from you. Best, Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)962-0781",

It was our first time in New Orleans and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this small and comfortable hotel. This hotel though not updated or as modern as others in the area felt cozy and just right. The staff was very professional and warm as well as helpful. Our favorites were Amy, Christina and Michell at the front desk. You will find that the towels are a bit worn and stiff but plenty are provided and are clean and fresh. When we ran out of fresh washcloths some were sent to our room within minutes. We went on a quiet week so we experienced no noise even though we were situated close to the elevator on the second floor. I can't forget to mention the breakfast tray brought to our room each morning, we enjoyed the hot coffee, warm croissants with melted butter as well as the orange juice and jelly. This was probably my favorite perk of this hotel. Who doesn't enjoy nibbling on a warm croissant in your pajamas while planning your day ahead Overall I would recommend this place to someone looking for a good deal on a decent hotel room in one of the best destination cities in the world.

                "text": "We had booked a multi-centre holiday and needed to book at least one night in a hotel for the best airfare - so we decided that we would book this hotel as part of our overall package. It had been a long journey, London to New York then change planes for the trip to New Orleans. When we arrived we were both hot and tired and as there was no bar in the hotel we felt a bit let down. We were told there was a complimentary continental breakfast delivered to our room. We had no great expectation for that either.HOW WRONG CAN ONE BEAs it turned out, the breakfast was excellent. We have holidayed in France many times and the croissants were as good as any we have had in France. The orange juice was also excellent. They have an outside patio area and we were told we could order breakfast to be delivered there - which we did every subsequent day. A great start to the morning.The hotel is really well located for the French Quarter - an easy walk in the evening.The staff on reception were really helpful and friendly and offered a lot of help in terms of getting around and parking our car - when we had collected our hire car after a few days.I am sure there may be flashier and more expensive hotels in New Orleans, but if I were to return I would have no hesitation in returning to the St James Hotel.",

We were first greeted by James, who came out, helped park the car, proceeded to get the luggage out of the trunk with care and take it in to the hotel and up to the room. He was very helpful in getting our room set up for us(a/c, frig, ect.). Working the front desk to check us in was Tori. He checked us in quickly, helped with mapping out points of interest, places to eat and things to do. We also had the pleasure of another front desk personally, Miss Danielle. Just as energetic and helpful as Tori and James. They helped make serveral reservations, ect. for us. There is nothing this staff of friendly, energy packed, helpful, willing to go beyond the norm, caring people will not do to make your stay the best experience possible. Making you feel like family is an asset! Caring about your day, experience, helping you get the best out of your time in New Orleans is what drives them. We can not say enough of the staff, not to mention that the hotel sets in walking destance to WWII Museum, River Walk, and the French Market just to name a few. We give them a 2 THUMBS UP!

There is a steak restaurant next door to the hotel, but I didn't get a chance to try the food there. For breakfast, just walk to Ruby Slipper, which is just around the corner from St James and you can get a delicious breakfast there. They open at 7am.The room I got was a bit small, but that was ok, as I did not spend much time in the room. Try to get a room with a window, or you may get claustrophobic. The bed was comfortable and the TV had good channels.Overall, I have very little to complain about this hotel, as it met my expectations for the price I paid.The only complain I have is that the walls are rather thin and in the middle of the night, I could hear my neighbors having a good time.Thanks for choosing to stay with us at the St James Hotel in New Orleans.

The little courtyards are a beautiful spot to sit with a glass of wine or coffee and enjoy the vibe of New Orleans.Check-in was smooth, and about :15 after I arrived in my room I received a text from the from desk making sure everyone was satisfactory. It was. The room was clean, large and comfortable. The bed was a good mix between firm and soft. Every morning they deliver coffee, juice, tea and freshly baked croissants to your room. It was a great way to start each morning before going out exploring.The location is very centralized but nice and quiet. I parked my car and didn't touch it again until it was time to leave. The hotel is about a few minute walk to the French Quarter and CBD, which both have a great selection of restaurants, activities and I highly recommend finding a spot to just sit back and people watch.Parking like most places in this area is high, I paid 30 a night parking myself, which was about 9-10 cheaper than valet. There is a self-service parking lot IMMEDIATELY across the street so it didn't put me out at all to park my own car.All in all, my stay was incredible and I highly recommend.

Outdoor spaces include a charming courtyard just off the lobby and. small but pretty pool area. Our king room while not huge was spacious with high ceilings and tall windows. The bed was comfortable and the room was very well appointed with a new large flat screen TV, a small refrigerator and a microwave. Other special touches included a complimentary breakfast of hot croissants, jam and butter and choice of orange juice, coffee or tea delivered up to the room. That was nice. I also liked that the toiletries included a small bottle of mouthwash along with Bath and Body shop soaps, shampoo and conditioner. About the only thing the room lacked was a full length mirror ( a must for any hotel IMO). Also there were no newspapers in the lobby such as you'll usually find in other CBD hotels.The location is quiet at night and close to the French Quarter as well as the Warehouse District. This is a great home base for foodies. The Bon Ton Cafe is right across the street. Chophouse steak house is accessible from the lobby. Le Foret, MiLa, Luke, Domenica, Herbsaint (great CBD restaurants all) are a couple of blocks away as are the wonderful restaurants of the Warehouse District.The rate for all of this was quite reasonable compared to similar hotels in the neighborhood, especially since this was a busy weekend (Saints home game, kickoff to fall wedding season) and many hotels we tried were booked up. My husband and I come to New Orleans frequently and like staying in the CBD. We had never stayed at the St. James before but we're adding it to our rotation after this pleasant stay.",

FIrst Ariel and Amy at the front desk were wonderful, both with checking in, helping with the car, finding places, etc... and I did test them. We got a room on the top floor with vaulted ceilings, redone bathroom all quite clean. Unfortunately I only got to use the free continental breakfast once on the last day and then only a bite, but it was there in front of my door as I requested, on time. The location was ideal EXCEPT if you had a car and it was during Mardi Gras. Streets do get closed off and that made it difficult, but only because we were going out of the city for a tournament with specific times. tHere was a lovely little courtyard. And the restaurant next door, The Chop House, that supplied room service was an excellent New York steakhouse.",

Rebecca asked us well placed questions to figure out our needs and changed our reservations on the spot to better suit us. She took time with us to make us comfortable and answer questions about New Orleans and how to get around. We were amazed at The Caribbean and Creole touches from the heights of New Orleanean elegance. The service was excellent, we were greeted coming and going as if we were family. The charm and ambiance of New Orleans' exquisite hospitality is all alive and well here. I will definitely make this my only stay in New Orleans. By the way- do eat one dinner at their restaurant The Chophouse. Oh, by the way, the French doors opening from the room to a courtyard and looking at palms and a fountain clinched it.

I sincerely thank you for the feedback so I can reach out to our housekeeping departments and front desk to figure out what may have been the issue. This experience is not typical of the service that the St. James is capable of providing and I apologize that this is the impression that you now have of the hotel service. I would love the opportunity to change that impression. Should you decide to give us another chance, please let me know. Warmly,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000jdragnanolahotelgroup.com",

Can't say enough about the staff and how friendly, pleasant and accommodating they were - in particular, Ariael, Christina, Amy Michelle (and the list goes on and on). Although it was a relatively short stay, it was a pleasure to feel like we truly welcomed by the staff there. And a tip for future guests, if you can convince Ariael to sing for you, you're in for a real treat - she broke out some John Legend for us on our wedding night, and we were absolutely blown away!",

Cheryl at the front desk was so friendly. She welcomed us and made us feel comfortable from the second we arrived. We went to our room and were pleasantly surprised. The room was beautiful, clean and very comfortable. We wanted to go watch the parades and Cheryl was so informative and helpful on where to go and what to do.

We stayed August 6th thru August 9th. From the time we got there, on Thursday morning. They were so helpful. Storing our luggage and telling us how to get around in New Orleans. Michelle was a Huge resource. She suggested places to eat (Mulates, Pralines, Ruby Slipper, etc.) which all had delicious food. She was also very helpful with explaning how to get to places and hooking us up with the bus tours. It ment a lot to me that she and the rest of the staff were so friendly and helpful. The hotel was decorated beautifully, the guest rooms were very accommodating and the beds were very comfortable. The location for excellent for us. It was within walking distance to the French Quarter, the World War II museum, Harrahs, the Aquarium, the mall, and the cruise terminal. This was definitely a hotel to remember and when I make it back to New Orleans we know where we will be staying.Dear Suyling,Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent experience at the St. James.

We read the reviews and booked this hotel kind of at the last minute.We had a room on the 4th floor which came with an outdoor, rooftop patio type space.Be aware that the hotel is still working on updating things so there is a lot of construction activity. Nothing that disturbed our stay but getting in and out, parking, and dust are things to consider. Parking was a challenge until we found the lot across the street for 30/day. If you drive a block further down on the right you may find 12/day as an FYI. The entry area has been moved so unloading and getting in/out is a challenge. The check in area is nice but quite dusty still as is the elevator and some of the halls and room.The room was very nice. We loved the exposed brick and wood joists. Very comfy bed, fridge, coffee maker, and microwave are all in the room ready to use. The rooftop patio area was a nice surprise given the warm weather and sun that weekend!The light breakfast delivered to the room was awesome. Great tasting croissant w butter and jelly and juice/coffee are delivered at the time you specify. And they were on time too. The staff was great and I would recommend this hotel to anybody.

Every time we entered the hotel we were greeted, the staff asked us how our day went and gave us great tips on where to go to catch some great jazz and good deals. Everyone was super nice.The room - was vintage and not your typical square room (under the eaves - it was great actually), we had a balcony with table to sit and enjoy the evening with a bottle of wine (corkscrew supplied by front desk - thank you). The hotel is within walking distance of everything (and I do mean everything). Bring good shoes to walk in because you will get your exercise in this city - but being close to everything also meant we didn't have far to stumble if we drank too much, could drop things off at the hotel if we bought too much and could return for naps in between outings.",

BUT for when we wanted to go, and what we wanted to visit, the St James could not be beat. So... we went back to the St. James. Our room was very, very nice and even had a balcony for morning coffee (too hot in early August for drinks later in the day ). The staff were all so gracious. The room was big, comfortable and clean. Breakfast is croissants and jam, along with drink of choice, which looked yummy and we have had in prior stays but this time we walked down to the French Quarter for beignets and cafe au lait (it is NOLA, after all). The St James is perfect for walking to the French Quarter or to the WWII Museum. And, if it rains around dinner time, there is a private covered entrance to a wonderful restaurant, The Chophouse. You just can't ask for more! We will stay there again!Good Morning Ms. Rose and Thank You for taking the time to give us your wonderful review on your recent stay with us! It is so lovely to hear about your stay as this makes us very happy. We will be sure to pass your kind words along to our Team. We look forward to your return soon! Thank You again and see you soon. Sincerely, Marie P",

I don't think I would use the valet service again, they were very slow. There is an overnight lot across Magazine St. I would use that in the future. The hotel staff said this lot gets full so they recommended the valet service. They did refund the cost for this service after we complained about how slow they were. Overall it was a pleasant experience. The location is ideal, just a couple blocks from Canal St and the French Quarter. Check out the Ruby Slipper for breakfast but go early or there will be a long line.",

The one that I stayed in was clean, modern and fine for one night or one week. I did not participate in the Free Breakfast as I woke up to late, There is free parking and if you miss breakfast there are plenty of places for breakfast or lunch nearby, This hotel is around 6 minutes or less from the main highway. I would stay here again.Thank you for being our guest at Extended Stay America. Its nice to know you enjoyed your time with us and were satisfied with all that we have to offer. We value your feedback and look forward to hosting you again soon.Sincerely,General Manager",

A couple of comments an not really complaints are that the fitted sheet on the bed was put on the bed inside out and was not fitted very well to the mattress (it just looked kind of sloppy) and there were spatter marks on the wall next to the bed that looked like they could have easily been wiped away. The rest of the room appeared to be very clean. They were even steam cleaning the carpets in the hallways while we were there. All of the staff was very friendly. Each of the housekeepers we met in the hall always gave us a friendly greeting. The breakfast offered a good variety and everything seemed fresh. A buffet meal is offered Monday through Thursday but we were not there on those days to be able to comment other than to say what was on the monthly menu posted in the room looked pretty good. The hotel is close to the airport , about 10 minutes to Virginia Beach Town Center, and only a 15 minute drive to Virginia Beach.

I would definitely stay here again.",

This was a great location for getting around, eating out and sight seeing. Although the hotel didn't t have its own restaurant, it did have a bar/restaurant next door. Plus there are lots of local cafes for a great breakfast. The only thing we were surprised with was the parking. The hotel only offered valet parking at 45 per night, however there is a multi story car park just down the road at 15 a day, we didn't use our car whilst there and only paid 30 for 2 nights parking instead of 90.I have to say San Diego was a fabulous place to visit and recommend the 'old town trolley tours' to see the sights. A visit to Coronado Island is a must...beautiful.Thank you for the 5 star review 25mary25! I'm glad you loved our location as much as we do! JSix is the restaurant for the hotel, I can certainly see how that can be confusing with the entrance not being right inside the hotel and off the driveway. I hope you are able to try it out next time, you'll love it! I'm thrilled to see that you had such a memorable trip to San Diego, I hope you come back and visit us again soon. Cheers! Shannon",

I was told by the front desk that our room already was an upgraded room, which was not true. It was almost like having Inner Circle status didn't matter except that I got my usual requested amenity. The room itself was decent and in true Kimpton style, Solamar had its own quirks with its nautical theme. It's starting to look a bit dated so hopefully they will renovate soon. The jacuzzi was good but nothing to die for. It was also bad that the restaurant was closed as I always want to try Kimpton's restaurants. I might stay here again but I'll probably consider the other Kimpton hotel down the street on our next San Diego trip.Hi Carlo, thanks for staying with us and for taking the time to post a review. The King Spa Corner room is indeed an upgraded room and our standard rooms aren't quite as large as the King Spa Corner, nor do they have the Fuji Soaking Tub like the one in your room. We have 16 suites on property of our 235 rooms, and they certainly get reserved up quickly. Sorry about the restaurant being closed during your stay. Jsix is an amazing restaurant, although it was time for a quick refresh. The new look is going to better match the amazing cuisine. We certainly hoped to impress you during your stay better than we did on this trip. I hope we get another chance on your next trip to San Diego, as we want our IC members happy at all costs.

First upon arrival I was quickly greeted by the valet and taken care of. They offered bag service but I was okay handling my own. I checked-in quickly with Q and headed straight up to the room on the 7th floor. When I arrived at my room the door was open. It was rather strange but I made sure I knocked and called out because I didn't want to walk in on anything I didn't want to see :)The room was clean. I had a window with a view of another building. Nothing too much there. The TV was massive and to be honest was pleasant because I didn't sacrifice my NFL experience away from home. Here's where my experience got a little ruff. At 4:30 am I was woke up by a screaming child in the adjacent room. I get it, kids are kids, but this screaming was more of an attention getting scream because there was no crying, just screaming. So I tried to sleep and eventually the child stopped screaming. Then at 6:30 the kid was playing and screaming at the same time. That was it, no more sleep for the day. I got up to take a shower just to leave, and that was when I noticed the shower head was leaking from the top, mildew in the tile cracks, and heavy mildew at the drain. Blocked that out of my head and just showered up. I will say the water pressure is on point. When I returned to the room later that day I tried to just relax, and then the kid started screaming. I didn't want to judge the kid and become angry so I called the front desk. Q answered and I explained to him what was going on. He even mentioned on the phone that he could hear the kid through the phone. He quickly provided me two options, I chose one and I was set for the rest of the trip. I moved to the 8th floor, view of the pool and not a peep from anyone or anything. In summary, Q is the reason my review is 4 stars. He saved my trip and experience. I was able to sleep uninterrupted! I knocked the score one point for the cleanliness of the bathroom in 706. The 8th floor bathroom was noticeably cleaner (816). Thanks for a great experience Q and Solamar. Will consider this location as an option in the future!Thank you CAm2317 for this detailed and candid review. I couldn't be happier to see that Q saved the day on your seemingly frustrating visit. I'm very sorry for the experience you had. I have shared your feedback regarding the door having been left open and the shower issue with our Executive Housekeeper for follow up with our team. That feedback is very concerning, it has not been taken lightly and will be used as a training opportunity for our team to ensure that such an experience does not repeat itself. Please feel free to contact me prior to your next visit and I will ensure you have a fantastic visit. Thank you again for writing. All my best, Shannon shannon.fosterhotelsolamar.com",

It's in a great location -- near the Gaslamp district and within walking distance of the Convention Center. The dcor is modern and trendy. We enjoyed the hotel's daily happy hour at 5 pm.We were surprised at the noise level from Room 619, there is no soundproofing, at all -- you can hear guests from adjacent rooms as if they were actually in your room. The noise from the hallway carries, as well as the noise from the 4th floor lounge/pool area!We had an early check-out on February 5. After checking with the staff the evening before, I was assured that it would not be a problem. The morning of our departure, the attendant on duty said he was unable to provide my receipts because he was running a process, but that he would e-mail them to me. Because this was work-related travel, I was explicit with what I needed him to e-mail me. I received an e-mail 1-1/2 hours later, it was missing one of two receipts I requested. I called the hotel upon landing in Baltimore and asked the attendant to e-mail the room receipt. Nothing. I called again at 7:24 p.m. and Martha (I believe) finally e-mailed the receipt.We parked a vehicle on site. The valets were always helpful. The 41 per day valet fee is steep considering some of the other hotels allow self-parking for 30.If we visit San Diego again, we'll look at other hotels before re-booking at this one.Hello Erp757,Thanks for the review. Were happy you enjoyed our location and happy hour with local beer and wine. Sorry about the receipt mishap- bad timing on our part. We find that our parking prices match those in the area with secured, in-and-out privileges. Hopefully you will give us another shot to impress you. Thanks again.",

The Hotel and the room itself were fantastic and the quality and cleanness of the room were top quality and couldn't be faulted, we had a bottle of champagne and a happy birthday card Which magically later in the day to a Comgratulations card! Which was a nice touch.One of the first things we did find however was that the safe didn't work, which with our passports and cash etc we sure needed. Reported on the phone and were told we could go out and Maintence would repair, that evening when got back it still wasn't fixed, so called again in the morning to ask again and when still not repaired that evening asked reception for 3rd time. Still wasn't repaired so gave up asking!!wine hour was a nice touch, was served most evenings by a lady from the phillipenes who was lovely whenever we saw her, unfortunately on the Tuesday after a long day at the Zoo, there was a older blonde lady serving who was simply Rude and was possible the rudest person we came across, at first we thought she disliked us for bring a younger crowd, however when speaking to other guests in the lift we weren't the only people to notice this.The pool area itself was lovely and offered lovely views over the Gaslamp, unfortunately service wasn't much better when we did visit with the barman being more interested in the baseball game on, than any customers.finally when we did get home to the uk, we checked our credit card statement to find we'd been double billed for our stay, so after long call trying to get someone to help from within the hotel a voicemail was left and the problem that should never happen was resolved quickly.Overall we lovely San Diego, the Hotel we loved and the rooms were lovely, the Valet staff were friendly and the cleaning staff very nice but unfortunately too much poor customer service soured our visit. Especially constant failings over the safe problem and the rude blonde wine lady.We don't ask much where we stay, just a clean room and friendly, smiling and helpful staff, Hotel - Great, Staff.....Customer Service courses needed for many,I suppose what you pay is what you get.",

The only downside - our room was overlooking the rooftop of a local nightclub so we fell asleep listening to the loud bass from the music. Otherwise great place and would go back again.Dear Mtxstarr,Glad you joined us, although I apologize for the lively neighborhood! There's not too many challenges that arise from a city with such amazing weather, but one of them is that a lot of the bars and restaurants in the Gaslamp are outdoor. That can lead to some issues with noise from time to time! One great room tip ask for a higher room overlooking the East Village (also known as the Ballpark District). There's less noise emanating from the local clubs there. Hope that helps and please come see us again.RobertGeneral ManagerHotel Solamar - a very Kimpton Hotel",

                "text": "Upon check-in, greeted by wonderful front desk (think her name was Erika). She was so thorough, considerate - walked us through neighborhood map along with restaurant recommendations. Seeing that we were saying for a week, she gave was able to accommodate us by giving a room on the higher floors - 9th floor (which we thought was great attention to service). Was quite thirsty having just arrived, it was great to turn around to see there was free lemon water offered in the lobby! Really nice touch! We also found out later they offer complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings (in the lobby) too!Room met expectation - walked in and was quite pleased. Lovely room decor, nice designer lamps. Although we didn't use it, definitely a beautifully supplied fridge full of soft drinks/water and a nice minibar selection of drinks and snacks. Wifi access was really good! Compared to other hotels I've stayed at, Solamar's internet connection was pretty fast - therefore, more time to relax (instead of just sitting in front of the laptop waiting for page to be loaded). Size of tv was nice and larger than we normally are used to. Also, the remote control itself was CLEAN (meaning, no gunk stuck on it or anything of that sort).Bed itself was slightly on the hard side, though, by the time we finished our day, we were too tired and didn't mind that too much. Good thing was that the pillows were quite nice and soft. Bathroom: it was cool to have it as a sliding door (note: no lock). Amenities - good supply. Shampoo, shower and conditioner is not the mini-sized bottles, rather bottles which are mounted to the tub wall, so well lasts for days ahead. Good counter space where you can spread out all your things. The only thing to really say is about the sink itself. The sink has great visual appeal, though functionally, doesn't work too well, splatter water all over the counter because the sink sits on top of the counter rather than being curved down (if that makes any sense). So, always had to wipe down the counter each time after use.In all, clean modern hotel, which I definitely would be a place to return to for my next San Diego visit!Thank you for the great, and very thorough, review. I'm thrilled that Erika made such a good impression upon your arrival, she is very friendly and fun to talk to. Thank you for your stay with us and I'm glad we had a positive impact on your vacation. Hope to see you again.",

Enjoyed the complimentary wine in the evening. Breakfast was good when we used the facility. the location can't be beat...close to bars and restaurants, and the bay walk. Valet parking is 40 a day...pretty high. would recommend hotel once they get the private event closures under control..Dear Susan S.Thanks for your feedback about your recent stay with us. I'm very happy to hear your kind words about our facility and the location certainly can't be beat! I did want to acknowledge your frustration about the event being held at our deck. As you can imagine, it's quite a popular space. Due to its large size we're normally able to section off part of it for private events so that all of our guests can enjoy the area. I appreciate the feedback about what you encountered and want to apologize. We'll make sure that we're cognizant about the best use of the area. Thanks again and I hope you can make it back soon.

Its kind of dark when you first walk into the hotel itself after being outside in sunny California. I didn't have to interact with the staff often but checking in and out was quick and they were friendly. I was happy that they allowed us to check in early without any problem. Since I'm from Texas, its not the norm to have to pay to park, especially 32 per day. So that was pretty steep and not pleasant. The valet guys were polite and tried to be quick in getting the car. Although I'd have preferred skipping the whole valet thing because I'd have saved money in the constant tips and it would've been faster. But I suspect that this was how it is at all the hotels in San Diego so I couldn't be that disappointed in the parking situation. The beds were comfortable and they had nice flat screen TVs. The rooms were very nicely decorated and I was impressed. The only odd thing was that there weren't any drawers. The bathrooms were also nice. I just love the Aveda toiletries that they provide. One complaint that I do have is that there is a nightclub in the building and around 11pm the music can be heard in the room for a few hours. Luckily I was tired enough to sleep through it but it is very loud. Overall, I wasn't disappointed and I'd probably stay there again but I'd ask for a room as far away from that club as possible.Thank's for your feedback.I am truly sorry that the music from our lounge keep you from a great night sleep. I am happy that your overall experience was positive. Thank's for staying with us.",

You wouldn't have even know they were renovating. The hotel is in a perfect location, one block off of the main street in the Gaslamp Quarter so you may walk to many restaurants, shops, the stadium, the convention center, Seaport Village and even the USS Midway. The manager Shannon is lovely and made sure our stay was perfect. The front deck staff was exceptional. George and I believe Tim were always available to give us directions and to give us great recommendations on nearby restaurants. We were traveling with our two teenage boys and they knew just where to direct us depending on whether the boys were going to join us for our outings. The bellboys/door attendants/Valets were always at the doors greeting us with a smile and an open door. When I asked one of them if they ever tire of opening the doors and smiling he responded with a smile and said, never. Also, a fun thing that you can do before you leave home is send them a few photos of who you may miss while you are traveling and they will put print the pictures and put them up in your room. Fun surprise even for the teenage boys. (I sent photos of our dogs.) We love the Kimpton Hotels and this was no exception. A lovely hotel in a great location with an exceptional staff. Also, their restaurant the Jsix was fantastic, we dined there with the boys and shared many starters, salads, sides and a charcuterie board. Probably the most delicious fun meal we had in San Diego. We will definitely stay at Hotel Solamar again when we head back to San Diego. Thank you for making us feel so welcome, we truly enjoyed our stay.Judith, you are very welcome!

You could easily drive past it when travelling down 6th Street but what a find. Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful as were the young staff at the entrance. The room we had was a 'suite' was perfect. Nice large living room area with a separate bedroom and large bathroom which included a Jacuzzi type large bath and separate shower. My only criticism is that the mattress on the large sofa bed which my son used was a bit rock solid!! Fridge in the living room was very handy with a large TV and another TV in the bedroom. As for the facilities in the hotel the outdoor pool and terrace area was excellent. Spotlessly clean there were plenty of sun loungers, cabana type rest areas (complimentary) as well as other soft seated areas with the bonus of a few 'fire-pits' which came on later in the evening to sit by. There was also a 'get together' hour daily between 5pm 6pm, either in the Hotel lobby or the adjoining 'J Six' bar. This comprised of free wine/beer and snacks and was very enjoyable. Also you had free coffee/tea every morning available in the Lobby area. The Hotel location is also excellent. One block away from the busy 'Gaslamp quarter' with many eating/drinking options, a ten minute walk to the Harbour area and only a couple of minutes walk from 'Petco Park' where the San Diego Padres baseball team play. All in all I cannot fault this hotel....staff were so helpful and friendly, room excellent and the pool bar area a delight to use. San Diego impressed me a lot and if I visit again I will be booking this Hotel without a doubt!!What a lovely review, thank you dingomell! I could not be happier to read all about your visit to the hotel, it sounds like you had a wonderful visit. I appreciate the feedback regarding the pull-out sofa beds, we will certainly take a look at those to see if we can do something about that, thank you for sharing your sons experience with that sofabed. I was particularly pleased to see that you enjoyed the little extra amenities we offer like the social hour and amenities at the pool deck. I love that there is no hesitation to come back and see us again. See you soon! Cheers! Shannon",

We chose the master suite, which had a private patio, large bedroom and doors that could close off the living area. This was essential because we had our 18 month old with us and it was so nice to be able to put him to bed and still be able to stay up and enjoy a bottle of wine, a movie, and grab drinks from the pool bar and hang on our patio. It was almost like we were on an actual date. The pool was lovely, and yes, the whole family was there, including the dog. The front desk staff was won over by his scruffy ways and kept giving him treats. He was in heaven - especially when we took him to Ocean Dog Beach, just a short drive away. We love Kimptons! I just wish the rooms with separate living area weren't sooooo much more . It's worth it when you have a little one - otherwise we'd have to tiptoe around in the dark for fear of waking him up or go to bed at 8pm - but it's harder on a family budget to spend that much extra on the room. Still...we had a fantastic time!",

Well done!Thank you Larry-AK for not only staying with us but for taking time to write about your absolutely lovely experience. We are very lucky to have Tina on our team and I could not be happier to see that her notes were one of the key highlights during your visit. I truly appreciate the feedback as does our team, we can't wait to welcome you and your wife back again soon. All my best, Shannon",

The first night of my stay, the hotel delivered a cheese/cracker/fruit plate (delicious). A paper was hung on my door each morning. The rooms were clean and quiet. The hotel was conveniently located to the Convention Center and in a safe location! Hotel staff were attentive and wonderful! The wine and beer reception hour (complimentary) was nice after a long day at work and play.Dear KrisG3333,Wow, thanks so much!

                "text": "I returned to Hotel Solamar in San Diego at the end of July for a conference.This hotel lives up to Kimpton's reputation for great customer service willingness to please you and make your stay great.This hotel is located one block from the Gas Light district and the emerging East Village which is gaining a reputation for great new restaurants adjacent to the San Diego Padres ball park.All staff members are on top of their game from the front desk staff to Jesse at the pool bar to Guadalupe the housekeeper for my room and Hormand the manager of housekeeping who served as the host of the nightly free wine and beer gathering in the lobby.The hotel is great for business, couples, families and solo. There was a group attending a digital media conference, a honeymoon couple from Italy, a recently engaged couple from San Francisco and families from all over the country with young children. The SD Zoo is a short distance away and is great for young and old alike.The pool is small but the pool area is large and accommodating for food, drinks and lounging to use pool. I was not there on a weekend so the limited number of loungers around the pool was not an issue.There is nothing not to like about Solamar and I would recommend staying there no matter what your reason is for being in San Diego.Hey Richard C thank you for the great review! It sounds like you had a wonderful visit to the Solamar and we couldnt be happier to see that! Its true we love what we do here, I think you felt that first hand from Jesse, Guadalupe and Holman during your visit. Again, thank you so much for the kudos we are happy you came and hope you visit us again soon! Cheers! Shannon Foster",

We arrived after a long drive and straight away we were hit with 3 big charges. 45 a day to park your car there which seemed slightly excessive! And then one of my biggest gripes with hotels...12 for wifi...I just don't get in this day and age how a hotel can still charge you for wifi. Then after a week of travelling down California we had quite a bit of washing...on average they charge about 6 per item. so it would have been over 100 just to wash a few items of clothing...luckily we found a laundrette on 4th avenue. (and free wifi in a caf round the corner)That's the bad stuff out of the way!Now the good stuff!Great location to discover San Diego. Was a walk to Balboa Park...and a walk to the harbour. They sent us a bottle of Champagne and strawberries in chocolate as a honeymoon gift (the only hotel on our honeymoon that acknowledged our celebration - not that we expect any freebies but it is nice!)The room was great...modern clean and spaciousTheres a nice rooftop area with seating bar and a small poolThe staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast is situated at the adjoining caf which was nice.So almost full marks but not quite!First off Lifeshouldbeaholiday, I love your username and 100 agree, life should be a holiday! Thank you for the candor used while sharing feedback regarding your visit with us. So happy to see that our team took such fantastic care of you and congratulations on your marriage! I know those additional charges can add up quickly, we do offer complimentary internet for our Kimpton Karma Rewards members (which is a free loyalty program) and fortunately the free internet with that program is good at all Kimpton hotels. We do occasionally offer exclusive deals for our Kimpton Karma guests as well that include discounted parking, if you choose to sign up, it will certainly help save some money on those additional charges. I hope we will be able to welcome you back again, maybe for your anniversary if not sooner. Cheers! Shannon",

We were a little worried on check in about the fact that our room was on the same floor and directly overlooked the pool and bar area but we shouldn't have been - there was no noise whatsoever and we had a great night sleep. Only downside was we had to keep our curtains closed.......Nice spacious room, comfortable bed, great bathroom and shower, free continental breakfast at the hotel next door and if you sign up as a Kimpton member you get free wifi and a voucher for drinks at the bar.Nice touches were the umbrella and bathrobes for comfort. Great location as a base for San Diego - only downside was the 42 a night parking but we couldn't be bothered with the hassle of finding it cheaper elsewhere.Would go back there again..........................Hello SarahH81,Thank you for the lovely review!

Requested cab in AM and staff was unable to secure - got own Uber instead. Arrived back at hotel at 6PM last day of stay and room was being cleaned - unacceptable! We went to the front desk to complain and were offered free drinks at Monkey Board and reassured would be completed soon as well as told that hotel was full - that was why cleaning being done so late - not the customer's issue at all and should not be used as an excuse. Major inconvenience as we had been at French Quarter Fest all day and were planning to rest a little before getting ready for dinner. Also, elevator setup is less than optimal. Big line in lobby to get up to bar interfering with guests trying to get to rooms. Also, didn't seem to be separate service elevator from guest elevator - another dissatisfier. Nice looking hotel - rooms were actually very nice looking/well designed and decent location but really need to get the service kinks out before I would recommend to others and/or return. Lots of other great choices in NOLA....Thank you for your comments Josh, I'm very disappointed to read we didn't exceed your expectations. Your concerns have been shared with my Front Office Manager and Director of Housekeeping so that we can improve. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and know that we can do much better. We definitely want to earn back your trust and certainly your recommendation. I'll be reaching out to you directly to see how we can do that.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager",

The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us.

The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments.

We heard from many other couples around the pool that had the same concerns and even the management staff when we commented on it said they knew it was an issue and were working on it. Three different managers said this. That said - Chris (the GM) addressed our concern and was fantastic. The front desk staff, housekeeping and bell staff were also very good. Their service at the Westin North property pool side is much higher at this time and I hope and expect that Nanea will get there soon. When you are on vacation you tend to spend a lot of time at the pool and thus was poor service there really stands out. Thanks Aloha Scott S,Mahalo for your review and your gift of feedback. Our General Manager, Chris Rabang, is always willing to go above and beyond to assure that each and every one of our guests is well taken care of. His leadership is a prevailing factor in our property's enormous success, despite only being open for 7 months. With that being said, we do regret that our Food and Beverage service did not meet your expectations. We will diligently address this issue and continue to improve our service. We hope that you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)",

The studio room we had was spacious and comfortable. Nice big shower his and her vanity. Though it had somewhat unsettling, disturbing artwork on the walls. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city but it's sadly not accessible 24/7 but only from 5 pm till last call. They should change that as I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable during the day. The drinks are extremely overpRiced. You're better off bringing your own drinks. I also would've liked to see a pool and whirlpool there but there wasn't. The restaurant had delicious breakfast and pastries and the servers were friendly and accommodating. A couple cons: The carpets in the room looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in awhile and a couple days they didn't stock enough towels or tissue. Also be careful to not leave valuables out, even food. We left some freshly boxed muffins on the desk that we intended to eat later but found they had been taken when we returned to the room hours later. The elevators kept malfunctioning that even the staff found inconvenient. The acting manager, Toriano, the first shift front desk people were extremely friendly, patient, competent and professional and compensated for any mishaps we experienced. They offered us a great deal for Mardi Gras weekend compared to the other hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting the city.Thank you for your comments, they are very important to us. They allow us to celebrate our successes, and also look for opportunities to improve. We will certainly share the details with our management team to make sure housekeeping is doing a more thorough job while cleaning the rooms while also taking care with guest items.

                "text": "Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. Happy Birthday!!! We appreciate you sharing your comments for others to get a feel of The Troubadour and our Monkey Board rooftop bar, we are excited to hear you enjoyed the atmosphere up there. The team will enjoy reading your comments and we thank you for recognizing all their hard efforts. We look forward to seeing you again soon, at least before your next birthday!WayneGeneral Manager",

The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour.

The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy!

The location is great, right on South Lake Union. It is walking distance to Pike's Market, Seattle Center, and great downtown shopping. There are several nice restaurants nearby, and easy on and off I-5. The Wi-Fi was free. We purchased breakfast with the room and the choices were off the menu, not a buffet, so it was just like going out for breakfast, freshly cooked. The bed was so comfortable. There was a good work space. The only downside was that the Market freezer was always sold out of ice cream when we go back. I'll definitely stay there again.Thank you so much for sharing your recent experience at our hotel. We are so happy to hear our hotel was the perfect fit for you recent trip to Seattle!We look forward to your next visit, and will be sure to have ice cream stocked in the market freezer in the evenings when you return!

The bathroom was amazing! However the toiletries were not replaced when the room was serviced daily. The walls were quite thin and we could hear the guy in the room next door! It wasnt horrendous and it didnt disturb us. It seemed to be very stylish but some of the finer points were missed. The upstairs bar was recommended to us on check in so we tried it out. We were really disappointed with the bar, it was a Monday night, and it was not busy. The staff seemed uninterested in us, we sat down and my dad went to the bar to ask a couple of questions, he was stood there for nearly 10 minutes, we decided to leave when eventually a member of staff spoke with him so we decided to stay. The first drink I wanted was a southern comfort, but they had none. Next I wanted a Gin and tonic but they had no tonic. In the end I had a cider which wasnt very nice. The bar staff continued to seem disinterested in us and we felt like a burden to them. It was nice sitting on the roof top and having a drink but that was the only bit of the experience we enjoyed. We did not use their car park because it was expensive, but it was in a good location for other car parks. We did not want to be in the middle of the French quarter and found that we enjoyed the 20 minute walk to get there from the hotel! It is in a good location for lots of breakfast stops as well. Hello Leah,Thank you for your stay with us. We are pleased to hear that your check in experience went well but we are sorry to hear there were some issues with housekeeping and the service you received at our roof top bar. These issues have been addressed with the team so that we may improve on this. We hope you will give us a chance to win you back as a guest.",

To top that off. This shouldve been something they credited me back asap, i shouldnt still be waiting for the money in my account days and days later, i dont appreciate how slow its taking the hotel to decide to refund me and get back to me, this made me negative in my account and accumulated bank fees. And not once has the hotel offered to compensate for the charges their mistake has made on my account and will continue to make until they put the money back into my account.",

                "text": "Due to its proximity near Key Arena (where I was seeing a concert), Id figure it would be best to stay at a nearby Starwood property. This particular location was about a 10 minute walk (1km) to the venue, with restaurants along the way, and its also near the Seattle Space Needle for those who want to do some sightseeing. Note that this property use to be under the management of Comfort Suites.I redeemed my Starpoints for this stay this was an SPG category 3 hotel, with redemption starting at 7,000 starpoints. Parking was 15/night and is underground and gated.A walk into the lobby and you can tell that it was recently renovated, with a huge lobby, dining, and bar area. There was a dedicated SPG check-in counter along with dedicated SPG rooms. This property was also recently upgraded to RFID sensor locks instead of the traditional old style swipe card door lock. This was a nice feature due to the recent security concerns with the swipe card locks.Upon check-in I was told that I received a complimentary upgrade to their Deluxe Room (from Traditional), which features larger rooms and a sofa/couch. The hotel window faces the Space Needle and the Bill Gates Foundation. I was also offered the choice of a complimentary drink or extra points. No point asking for complimentary wi-fi since their wi-fi cost is already included in the room price.For those who dont know, Four Points is considered one of the budget brandings for Starwood. I came here with no high expectations at all. However, to my surprise, I would consider this a pretty good property with clean rooms and comfortable bedding. In fact, I would have given the staff members my remaining 4 x 500 starpoints codes.if I hadnt forgot about them at home. Highly recommended.Thank you very much for the review. We are pleased to hear we exceeded your expectations and you enjoyed the comfort of your room. Are staff are among our best assets and we are thrilled to hear they made your stay pleasant. Thanks again for your kind words.",

We booked online through their website using a AAA discount and scored a two-bedroom suite with a mini kitchenette for about 240 a night. The suite was spacious, and having a coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator made our stay in Seattle feel like staying at home. The lobby and my suite were clean, modern and renovated. The beds are comfortable -- even the convertible sofabed in the living room. The hotel is located a little less than a half mile north of the Seattle Center where the Space Needle, EMP museum and Pacific Science Center. My family had a great time in that area. The location is in what I'd consider a developing area. It's not touristy it's near a few auto shops, a business plaza and a few blocks from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We felt perfectly safe walking in the evening and there are plenty of eating options, like a nice Pho Viet Anh and the corner QFC market which is open 24 hours.We took the monorail for 2.50 each way to get to Pike Place. That walk was a bit much for my 5 year old, so we took a taxi the next time and paid about 15-20, I believe. We stayed there for 3 days before the cruise, and I would be glad to stay there again. If you can afford it, you might want to stay closer to the Downtown area or Pike Place, but if you're looking for an affordable, spacious, comfortable and clean place, you might want to consider this place.",

When we entered the hotel lobby there were a ton of people either waiting for rooms or trying to check in. It seemed there was no organization at all.I am an SPG member and booked one king room on points and booked a 2 bedroom suite at full rate. At the desk, I was not greeted as an SPG member. I was told our rooms would not be available until 3pm. It was about 10am. I complained a bit and was told the hotel was fully booked the night before and there is nothing available. My group and I decided to book a tour of Seattle to pass the next few hours.We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and found only one room available. Needless to say, this did not sit well with my group. We were all very tired and just wanted to get to our room to relax. About 45 minutes later, a room was found for us and we were told to head up...except and the other desk attendant said No, that room is set for another person. The woman helping us said that the room in question should not have been given to another party. Now we are mad. Finally the woman helping me found yet another room. I told my party our initial room was given away and that second desk attendant chimed in with no it wasn't. Those other people have been waiting since 7 am! Once we finally received the room key we grabbed our luggage and tried to get on the elevator. What a mess that was! There was a group of folks with a luggage cart filled to the brim trying to maneuver it onto the elevator. It was too heavy for the elevator so they were stuck half in and half out blocking up the hallway! Finally we got through and went up to our room.Our room was the 2 bedroom king suite. It was a nice room. Unfortunately there was a big iron mark in the rug but it was clean. There are no phones in the bedrooms. Only one phone on the desk in the living room. The room was spacious and comfortable. There is only one bathroom. It has 2 doors, one opens to the main living area and the other opens to a bedroom. One problem in the bedroom was the door stop for the bathroom door is right by the bed where you step when getting out of bed! That is a design flaw that really should be corrected! The bath was large and clean.As usual in the Sheraton chain, the bedding is fantastic! Overall, the room was great for what we needed. It slept the three of us comfortably. The location is good to the Space Needle. The area is a bit rundown but there are some places to eat, which we did not do. I would stay here again if they work out the delays in check in. In the meantime, if you are staying here, I suggest you request a guaranteed early check in time to avoid the hassles we endured. I did explain all of these concerns on my SPG emailed survey and was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the hotel manager via email. He apologized for the circumstances and said the hotel is working on the influx of cruise passengers and trying to figure out its policies for check in times. His prompt response was unexpected and completely appreciated! I was also issued some SPG points as compensation. Because of his attention I do not hesitate to recommend this property. It is a fair price in a good location with fantastic beds!",

The suites are really nice, but not worth the extra money as the standard rooms include a small sitting area and a large desk that spans the long wall. The Wednesday night grill they include with the local brews deal is more than enough to make a dinner out of as well. Underground parking is really nice during the cold and rainy months. Within walking distance to the needle, but not near Pike's Market at all, would have to drive to get to that and parking downtown near that area is pretty expensive.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on our hotel. We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay at our hotel and that you found our staff to be friendly. Its also great you were able to take advantage of our Wednesday night Best Brews BBQ evening reception. Our convenient location is not only walking distance to the Space Needle, but there is alternate transportation available to and from Pikes Market and the downtown business district, such as Monorail. Plus, our front desk is always happy to help arrange local transportation. These alternative transportation options may be less expensive than parking downtown depending, of course, on how long one plans to stay. Thanks again and we hope to see you soon. Take care.",

It was very conveniently located for sightseeing as the Space Needle and Chihuly Gardens are only a ten minute walk away. We ate dinner at the restaurant at the hotel, and the food was good. The portions are generous. The waiter was very friendly and told us stories about working as a commercial fisherman in Alaska. Everyone at the hotel is very friendly. We did have one odd experience. They signed us up for a shuttle to take us to the cruise terminal, simply putting us on a list. When the shuttle driver dropped us off at the terminal, he told us we needed to give him a voucher or pay him 7 per person. This was odd since no mention was ever given of the need to have a 7 voucher when we talked to the front desk about the shuttle. I'm not sure what happened there, but since everything else went so well, I'm thinking it must have just been an oversight. I was more than willing to pay for the transportation, but it just felt very awkward. Overall though it was a very good visit. Dear Christine, Thank you so much for your kind review, we really appreciate your comments regarding our convenient location, the Fire Side Cafe restaurant and our friendly staff! I am very sorry for the miscommunication about the shuttle to the terminal. We should have been more efficient at communicating the 7 cost per person for the transportation. We are very happy you had a good visit over all, and hope to see you again the next time you are in Seattle!",

We met the other bartender on our last night and it was a horrible experience. The breakfast staff was good. The food in the restaurant was much better than expected. The location is great (minus the construction).The front desk staff was mediocre at best. While they were nice...nothing was above par.Your feedback is much appreciated. Were disappointed to hear that your experience in the restaurant was less than par on your last night.

The next AM we were able to use a meeting room to prepare for our business meeting in Seattle (walking distance from the hotel, in fact). While the hotel does not have a lot of frills but the kitchen was open until 10:00 and the bar until midnight and the staff was both accommodating and friendly. The hotel had a functional exercise room that is open 24 hrs (six pieces of standard equipment and a set of weights) which is adequate for the number rooms. Although ostensibly a tobacco free facility I was fairly certain that one of the previous guests smoked extensively in my room which detracted from my visit as did the noise from the ice machine directly opposite my room. The room in fact was a roomy king with a good desk with multiple power outlets. WiFi was complimentary. All in all the price was right compared to other higher end places in the neighborhood.Thank you for sharing your review. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your experience while staying with us and are glad we were able to assist you in preparing for your business meeting. We take great pride in providing our guests with a smoke-free environment and apologize for any lingering traces of smoke. We will share this feedback with the team to ensure this does not happen again. We are glad you found our team to be both friendly and accommodating and we look forward to seeing you again, Steve.

One suggestion is to request an interior room as it may be quieter. Earplugs are provided (which says something), but I couldn't sleep in them. Also, if you are a coffee drinker, go ahead and ask for extra coffee pods and creamer at the beginning. Restaurant food was very good for breakfast and dinner.",

It's within walking distance to Seattle Center which makes it great if you're going to the Pacific Science Center which was the reason for our visit. The room was great and the staff was very helpful. It's kind of tucked away in a semi-industrial looking area which concerned me a little bit at first because we had our young children with us but after walking around the neighborhood at night I realized it wasn't a problem. There is a QFC (grocery store) just around the corner which was great for grabbing snacks for the room and a quick bite before we hit Seattle Center. You can walk to Pike Market from here but it's about 1.5 miles away. We just walked there during the day and took a cab back to the hotel at night. All in all I enjoyed the stay there and would recommend it if you want to be in the Seattle Center area.",

You can hear people walking, talking, running. If you have kids staying above your suite, good luck on getting any sleep. While having breakfast, in the morning, the fire alarm went off, and it was very loud and went off for quite some time, possibly 10 min, we were all looking at each other, thinking what to do, while the staff was walking around casually, there was no direction, evacuation procedure, zero communication. Finally, we asked one of the servers if he knew what was happening, he explained that they will be here soon to fix it. That was it. After we checked out, my wife realized that she had left her gold bracelet on the night table. We phoned the hotel and returned only to find nothing and that the staff no e speak English. Only the cleaning staff has access to a securely card-lock controlled room. We are told basically too bad, so sad. We wrote letter and called the hotel and head office. The same response, sorry, could not find it Basically, the gold bracelet walked out of the room on its own. Very dissatisfied and unhappy. Very unresponsive management. Will not stay there, nor will we recommend it. We paid to stay at a hotel and get robbed.Dear Valued Guest,We appreciate your candid response. I apologize on behalf of Four Points by Sheraton that your stay was not as expected.Yes we are a fully renovated new hotel in Seattle, and I apologize for the fire alarm. When this happened we were instructed by the Fire Department to wait until they arrived to silence it.Regarding your gold bracelet, as we discussed earlier, we did do a thorough investigation looking for this and questioned our staff. The Housekeeper that cleaned your room is a trusted and valued employee. It is unfortunate the bracelet was missing, but were not able to locate it anywhere.I apologize for these situations again. By far, most guest experiences here are excellent and guests are pleased. If we are able to have you back please contact me so that I can personally make sure we take care of your stay.Thank you,Joe AlbertsGeneral Manager",

After booking, I immediately reviewed the information and noticed the date was incorrect. So I called them to make the necessary correction. Apparently, it routed to a different date because the preselected date was not available (that's what the agent told me). They would not give me a refund, allow me to change my date, or even a credit to be applied to future reservations (not even a partial credit!). Now I'm stuck with a reservation that I can't even use. Thus, this review will only be limited to the customer service as I won't be able to use the reservation to enjoy the room. After this experience, I'm boycotting the Hilton. It's unfortunate as I always choose the Hilton above other hotels. No longer a fan!We thank you for submitting a guest survey. It is very unfortunate that you booked a non-refundable/non-modifiable reservation online. This review, while being pointed at our hotel as the one providing poor service, highlights the drawback with booking these type of reservations online. Hilton urges guests to book reservations through our websites. While these other internet booking sites offer a significant discount, the reservations mostly are not guaranteed a specific room type (king or double) and, most importantly, the reservations are not modifiable and cannot be canceled. This is clearly stated through the website that you booked on. Please use Hilton.com to book your stay. With our reservations, we have the flexibility to assist you when reservations need to be modified.",

Upon arrival, Nina (super sweet and friendly) assisted us and let us know that our room was not ready yet so they stored our luggage and said they would email us when it was ready. We never received an email but headed back around 4pm and it was ready. They had defeathered the room per our SPG profile and even upgraded us to a Cool Corner Room. I was so excited! Their W Insider (concierge) had emailed us prior to the trip and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We told them it was our anniversary and he was able to upgrade us as a surprise. Along with the upgrade, was a bottle of champagne on ice and some homemade gummy bears which totally put a smile on our faces. That's hospitality at its finest. The room was super clean and the view was amazing with 4 large windows. The room also had a really nice chaise lounge that couple be separated into 2 seats or combined for 1 lounge. It was really comfy. The W mattress is also really comfy and I liked that the bed was lower to the ground. The AC was also really quiet which provided us 2 nights of really good sleep. In the evenings, they had live music in the Living Room and after 9pm they had a DJ so it was sort of a party atmosphere at night but no noise could be heard from the room aside from city street noise. Overall, we had a great experience. The staff always greeted us when we walked by and the valet guys always opened the doors for us. I hope to visit again soon!PS- it's a 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. No need to rent a car as everything was within walking distance. WOW, thank you for sharing about your recent visit 882triciam, we appreciate the opportunity to be part of such a special event! It sounds like you were able to take advantage of our location to check-out everything Seattle has to offer, including some live local music in the Living Room.

This time, we decided to make a night of it and stay at The W Seattle. Received a pre-stay message from W Insider, Mykaela, with great dining recommendations near the hotel. As it was our first night away from our baby boy, I replied back to Mykaela to see if she could set up a special surprise for my girlfriend. She replied back and was excited to help out with my little request. When we arrived, we were welcomed by Rachel, who was inviting and funny, and got us into our room. When we entered the corner room with a west view, right on the desk was a amenity and card from Mykaela, wishing us a happy anniversary, along with the little surprise for my girlfriend a stylishly framed picture of her and our baby boy so that she wouldn't miss him too much. After checking in and refreshing from the drive, a short walk took us to Century Link Field, just in time for kickoff. After a win for the Seahawks over the Eagles, we walked around the city, popped into a little Mexican joint for dinner, then back up to the room to enjoy the city view and Stellina Di Notte amenity.The next morning on our way out, as we were waiting for the elevator, the room attendant on the 17th floor greeted us from another room and thanked us for staying. Nice acknowledgement.At check out, Mykaela was at the desk and got the chance to thank her in person for the personalized service. Stored our bags for the morning to grab brunch, before heading back up to Vancouver. Short but really sweet stay. Thanks W Seattle...and Go Seahawks.WOW, what a fabulous review, and I am thrilled that we were able to make it special for you both! And we agree, Mykaela IS amazing, and we are thrilled to have her on our team! We appreciate you staying at W Seattle, and we hope to see you back next time you are in the city!

They must not have these beds at this location, as one of the receptionists hadn't even heard of the Heavenly Beds! Further, the water pressure in my room, located on the 10th floor, was abysmal despite having housekeeping try to make an adjustment to the shower head valve. The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well, as I had a late check-in (10pm), and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar, which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma, the pleasant check-in receptionist, asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger, more satisfying water pressure.Hello WillinLa, thank you so much for your feedback on your recent stay at W Seattle.

Still, the room was fine, the bedding good, and the cleanliness what you'd expect for a higher end hotel. Not sure what's up with the very loud air conditioning, though. Even on its lowest fan setting, the noise level was so high that my husband and I had to raise our voices to be heard. Overall, an okay experience in a hotel that used to be much more than okay.Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. I am really sorry about your experience with the Air Conditioning in your room.

From the first point of contact at the front desk (I think the woman who checked us in was namedMikala), to the restaurant staff, and housekeeping - everyone was so welcoming and kind. The rooms were very modern and clean. Good amount of space and great amenities. Hotel is conveniently located within blocks of Pike Place, restaurants, and shopping. I prefer to not stay too close to Pike Place because of the crowds. Starbucks is located right across the street, which is great if you need coffee every morning. Not sure when I'll be back in Seattle, but I'm definitely staying at another W property soon.

Staff was great! - very helpful. Mykaela helped us along the way answering a bunch of questions and checked us out - remembered us by name! Kyle helped - and booked a tour for us. Cleaning staff had the room immaculate every day. All in all, a great visit!Hello RZ52,Thank you for your feedback. I am happy you enjoyed your stay and service of the hotel. I hope your travels bring you back some time soon!Warmest Regards,Nadia",

Business conditions required that I work overnight and sleep during the day, and the blackout curtain was quite effective at keeping out light. I almost never heard any noise from other rooms or the hallway either, and city noise was nonexistent away from the window (except for the occasional siren). Hotel staff was very helpful with any requests. The exercise room has a lot of equipment for workouts. The bed was very comfortable. Room service is a bit pricey.Hello Daniel S, many thanks for your great review on your recent stay at W Seattle. It sounds like you were BUSY while here! I am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the black out shade as well as the room stayed nice and quiet for you to get some rest! We do look forward to welcoming you back next time you are in the city. Thanks again!",

When you are connected to the hotel, in the hotel's actual building, you should take room charges.",

The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area.",

The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent.

The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there.

Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel. Which it is, but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations. (Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people). Hello Angy F,Thank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback! At Suncoast, we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests. Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate. It is disappointing to learn that we were unsuccessful in meeting these high standards during your time with us and I am sorry that it caused you to have less than a five star visit. Your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate management so that they can address and resolve the issues you have reported. Again, I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments.",

                "text": "Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently, It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises, although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course. Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days. Good luck in winning a jackpot!",

We were in a suite, the living room was comfy, ample workspace for two people. We were there the week before Mardi Gras on a business trip. Check in evening, our toilet overflows, we use all the towels in the bathroom to mop after we disable the float. Call to front desk. Immediate response. Front desk guy has a plunger and a plastic bag, comes in an plunges the toilet. Clears the paper. Says he's not supposed to plunge toilets. Leaves us with wet towels (and used toilet water) behind the toilet. Fortunately, the room is not level, so all the water stays mostly behind the toilet. Housekeeping gone, so fortunately, we still had two clean towels for a.m. and the detritus is not near our feet. Next day, some towels replaced, and housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom and skimpy on towels. Second day, housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom. Third day I notice that a little piece of plastic wrapping that I had binding some brochures in my suitcase was still laying on the floor in the bedroom. Shower has not great water pressure but is nice and roomy too. Hair dryer was awful. One day we were still in the room when housekeeping came, and when we came back in the early evening our room was not done. A call to front desk and our room was cleaned (with the leftover spray bottle in the bathroom) by time we got back from dinner.So, it's clean but some staff are a little forgetful. I was not bothered by the issues, it's a quirky little hotel. With a quirky staff...very laid back and quite fun!What did bother me, though, was one day I went down for breakfast. A youth bus group had been there the night before and they devestated the free breakfast bar. By 7:30 a.m. (the breakfast is open until 9 or so), most of the hot food was gone, and the server said they were done for the day. Huh Otherwise, the breakfast bar was nice, all the usual stuff. The evening reception was really nice. The hotel is close to convention center, French Quarter, and all the fun places.Overall, I'd stay there again, I'm hoping that the housekeeping issues were quirks and next time I'm bringing my own hair dryer. It did have free internet in the rooms, a huge plus.",

I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner.

                "text": "We stay at this property at least once a year when we head to Vegas to visit family. We like the location, off the strip in more of the residential area. The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas. Suncoast isn't the only game in town!",

Upon entering, we immediately noticed how strongly it smelled of smoke (much stronger than any other casino we've ever been in). Our room was spacious enough and clean, though dated somewhat in appearance. The toilet in our bathroom leaked a bit and the brass towel racks were all scratched up as well. The wallpaper was peeling off in a spot or two. Our toiletries were not replenished at all during our stay, but we didn't bother to call about it. The price of course is ridiculously low. My husband and I aren't big gamblers, so thought we would enjoy some time by the pool. We were surprised at how small the pool was and that there were no poolside servers. It is more like any backyard pool rather than a pool for a large casino. There is a TGI Fridays near the pool, which we were able to get drinks from and ate at a couple of times. The food and service there was very good. There is a bar by the pool, but it wasn't open at all during our 4 day stay. This property is a good 30 minute ride from the strip, which is about a 50 cab ride one way! For us personally, we would much prefer to stay closer in as we like to site see and visit different restaurants. The pool is also a large deciding factor for us as well.",

It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!",

( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!",

I arrived at 2:00 pm for a room which I had pre-paid for and they were out of rooms so they can me an upgrade to a 10th Floor Penthouse suite at no extra cost, it was amazing and very large.I had come a few years later for a weekend function but stayed next door at the Marriott. Suncoast is almost as nice but far cheaper.Sunday Brunch was OK but a good deal for 19.00 ( you get a discount at all restaurants if you get their free membership card). I didn't try other restaurants. They are building a lot of Shops and restaurants across the street.I like the area as well, quiet and close to Red Rock Canyon.",

I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!",

Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!",

It is far from most everything else. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Located in a beautiful place near golf course. We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip. We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one. We used the pool which was very nice, not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats. Overall very happy and would stay again.",

On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!",

Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.",

If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast.",

The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us. All of the rooms are spacious, but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable. We never stayed in the one bedroom suite, but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms. The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room. We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite (one of four in the hotel) room 960. We were booked in the Med. suite, but decided to accept the up-sell upgrade and pay the extra 124 per night to check it out. While it is about 1,000 sq ft larger than the Med. the huge common area was wasted on the two of us. The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom. The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains, once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage. The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head. The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall. The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower. I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel. The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water. You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox, I must comment about their toiletries. The shower/bath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box. The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap, but the kicker was the hand/face soap. It was a little round disc in a plastic package. When I opened it to use it, I thought it was a recycled soap piece! It had no lather and was just crap. If anyone from the property reads this, you really need to re-think these products as they scream CHEAP. The rest of the facility is a midstream casino/resort experience. Granted, you are not on the Strip, but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area. The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent. The Deli. offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu. There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we didn't try. The pool appears to be small for the property, so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it. The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking. Overall, not a bad place, but just OK.Thank you for posting your comments on your recent stay. I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address. I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer. Have a nice day.",

The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip.",

The rooms are small, but that is to be expected in NY. I had a king room and there was plenty of room to get around and for two suitcases with 2 adults. The bathroom was rather small, so be prepared. They do charge a resort fee, which included a drink ticket and laundry. Sadly, when you are only there a weekend, you do not need laundry, so that is a bit of a waste and un-needed. But definitely use the drink tickets in the hotel lobby bar since you paid for it! This hotel met all my needs and would stay here again if back in NYC.",

The hotel is right next to the highway, which for me is a security concern. The staff was not overly friendly. The room is a bed and shower, not overly nice, or clean. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower only (not your most comfortable stay) OR cannot afford a nicer hotel this is the place for you. Although the attached Denny's is convenient, it is dirty and we were served cold food. Hope this helps make your decision.",

Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service.",

We picked this hotel due to the price and reviews, knowing that we would have a little walk to the GasLamp quarter. However the hotel did not disappoint. As it suggests it is close to the bay (3blocks) and right next to Little Italy which has a great selection of restaurants for the evening. We were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast options and as long as you don't leave it too late you'll get a seat. The rooms are large(we had 2 kings) and all have balconies. There is a pool and jacuzzi off the lobby which seemed well used and clean. The only problem we had during our stay was the toilet not flushing, but when pointed out, this was fixed whilst we were at breakfast. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend. 4 tips: when using the wifi, you need to log-in on your browser (for free) before you can use Facebook etc...and go to the Altitude bar at the top of the Marriott GasLamp for great views of Petco park and the bay (don't worry though as its free to go up and drinks didn't seem much more than in GasLamp generally...9.50 for glass of wine)....also go to Coronado if there's time, worth a trip... And finally it may start off grey but don't be fooled, it will brighten up.",

Needs outside repairs, upgrading.I will stay there again but I will insist on a ground floor room.Thank you for taking the time to review our property.

The next morning we tried to get into the safe (which they charge you for regardless of whether or not you intend to use it) and, upon trying to open it, it got stuck. We spent our morning calling the front desk several times to send someone up to help us with it, who just assumed we had forgotten the key, though we explained many times the key was in there, it just wasn't working. Turns out, the door hinges were weak and the door wasn't sitting right. The maintance people said (who were very nice) said they would come back and open it again anytime we needed it, but, seeing how long it took the first time, we decided to just risk leaving our stuff out instead. Finally, breakfast. This is what brings my review down to a 3. I wasn't expecting much, but I would like more than corn flakes and stale danish if you are advertising breakfast. Also, the part that really really really bothered me: Everything is styrofoam! Every drink cup, every bowl, every plate they use is just killing the environment. Futhermore, their tiny maze of tables gets packed, but there are signs saying not to take things out of the room. Do they expect guests to sit on each others laps!!! Oh, and by 8:30, there is nothing left to eat (except corn flakes, which I had every day). This is is more frustrating by the fact that both days there was service person just sitting in there. Not sure what her job was...So, bottom line, if you're just looking for a place that is close to the park and this is the cheapest, go for it, just keep your expectations very low, plan on walking, and bring your own cups bowls. :)",

However what a disappointment the food was! The eggs tasted like slime. The mini Mickey waffles were always undercook even with the timer. The orange juice was always too watered down. It tasted more like water with orange flavor. And there was never any bacon! No American breakfast is complete without bacon. Don't even get me started on the dinner. Yes it was so bad we had to order papa johns pizza on Wednesday night and after giving the dinner another chance on Thursday we still had to order out. The pullout bed was terrible. I felt bad that my nieces had to sleep on it. I've never been to prison but I could imagine that prison beds were better than the coil bed they were sleeping on. It was so bad one of my nieces ended up sleeping on the couch and the other on the floor with extra blankets as her cushion. The kitchen, though very small, ended up being great because I was able to go to a local grocery store and stock up on snacks and cold cuts for the kids. If you are like me and are staying here for the benefit of food, don't do it. The food is something I would never serve to my own family. And if you are planing to use the pullout bed than plan for a bad nights rest for whoever has to sleep on it. I have stood in other Homewood suites and I am a Hilton Honors member so I expected it to be better but it wasn't. However everything in the room was clean. The maid was very diligent and I liked being able to use the laundry on site. The staff was also very friendly, especially the lady that works at the check in desk at night. Simply put, if the food was better quality and better tasting like other Homewood suites than it would get more stars.",

There is a bit of traffic noise from the street (I was on the 3rd floor) but this is to be expected downtown in a major city. (plus I was there the day the St. Patrick's day parade occurred, and its route took it right by the corner of the hotel). I didn't use the restaurant but it looked very decent. It's quite close to the various things to do or a quick cab ride away if you don't want to walk. I would certainly stay there again.Thank you for the great review and for your visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! It certainly was a pleasure hosting your stay.

We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!",

I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.",

                "text": "Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.",

True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)",

                "text": "We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!",

They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT",

After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!",

Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!",

The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.",

There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu.",

The baggage guy was so nice and loaded my stuff back into my car and waited for my husband to go get car. We arrived at The Inn at Lincoln Park and it did offer parking for 30 per night and we were so tired of riding in the car we said sure. They have window air conditioners and no electric door and no elevator. I was less than thrilled but we were not going to let it ruin our night. Get to the room and it is extremely small and you have to keep you curtains open if you want air to get into the room. Everything was pretty old and out lamp shade had a big stain on it. The pillows were like postage stamps and it was def no frills. We were woken at 6 am by a loud drilling from below. Not sure what it was but I guess that is the city. The price, even being in the city was ridiculous and I should have used a Groupon for a nicer hotel and took the train to concert. This place was not that close, even to walk. I guess if you like no frills and high prices you should stay here.",

Hampton Inn's normally being consistently clean and consistent, I decided to make the reservation. The staff at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, all shifts, while there. The room was small, noisy. The television never worked the entire stay. We have to call someone from the hotel, every time we wanted to turn it on! Some issue with the cable or buttons in the back, it was nothing but fuzz. When they would come to fix it they would say I think that's got it and then we would have to call again. There was a piece of debris on the tile floor in the entry way, never got cleaned up the entire stay. How do you not see a piece of dark colored debris on a light color tile floorThe hot water and pressure in the shower was an issue, just as I have seen others report on this site. Took forever to get hot water, no matter whether AM or PM. Pressure very low. This was a leisure trip and regardless, it would be nice to have all of the necessities you pay for when away from home.Dear Janice E,I appreciate the review of your recent stay at our hotel. Im very sorry that we fell short of your expectations. I hope you give us another chance to serve you if your travels bring you back to our area. Please know that we value your business and will work hard to earn your trust once again. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience. If you would like to discuss further, please feel free to call me at 404-589-1111Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager",

An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready...

The lobby was full of customers who could not check in also, at least 7 different reservations where being held up. Front desk staff had to leave check the rooms to see if they had been cleaned at 10:30! Thankful, my room was ready by then, not sure how the others made out as I wasn't sticking around to hear the complaints. The breakfast consist of powered scrambled eggs, powered egg cheese omelette, under or over cooked bacon, link or patty sausage (only one meat a day, fruit that was not fresh, and broken waffle, coffee, other machines during the week. It's food with zero taste. One of the two elevators has been out of service for the entire 8 days I have been here. The maids did do a good job cleaning the room every day. The picture on the website for the pool is a straight out lie yes, it has a pool, and no, it is only a average to small pool in size. More than 15 guest at any times makes it a little jammed. Overall, it's a room a bed.",

The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a nice breakfast area. People have complained that it is small (which it is) but breakfast can be taken back to your room, which I preferred. There is a computer/printer available to print out tickets/boarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an online-only deal. We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once (on the first night) and found it really nice. It was during a Karaoke night, so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent (although I didn't sing!) I wish I'd booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast, and I already want to go back. I would book here again, although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis (it's a good 30 minute drive each way) but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall, and some other amenities (such as the Airport)",

There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money.",

Adding some color to the walls, fabrics finishes, and beginning the process of incremental replacement of furnishings would elevate the hotel to the next level without breaking the bank, and allow the hotel to keep its very affordable rates intact. The location was great, in that it was a short walk or drive to much of Arlington's riverfront, the downtown commercial center, the METRO station, and the Key Bridge and Georgetown. The hotel is located on 1 mile from Interstate 66, so vehicular access was great. The beds were very comfortable, but the rooms were underwhelming from a design standpoint. The only problem I encountered was that air conditioning unit seemed a bit undersized. Overall, it was a very nice place to sleep, and I would stay there again, especially if cost were an issue.",

They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch.",

To call it a plus just because it has internet a pool and breakfast is a long shot. Let me give you a brief rundown. The hotel is a 10-15 min cab ride from the airport, there is a shuttle from the airport for 38 pp (all ages) return from your hotel, but a cab for up to 3 passengers was a flat rate of 14 pp one way, there were 3 of us so we cabbed it. Check in was ok, no worries, we had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool....big mistake.....TV wasnt working, reported it to front desk the first day, they forgot, after a sleepless night listening to people come and go at all hours right outside our room and walking back and forwards along the balcony we mentioned it to the front desk and 2 young men were very helpful, one was Lawrentey and the other I cannot remember his name..we mentioned TV not working and no light globe in our bathroom light, but the person who was going to fix it had left so they gave us another room, next door....at least the light worked and the TV.......5 out of 6 nights were noisy noisy noisy, security is apparently on site 10pm-7am but I suspect who ever it was had gone home with the maintenance person as well, never saw them, never heard them....spoke to the front desk and it would appear they may just be one of the many ghosts in the French Quarter. We had 2x double beds and they were hard and air con noisy but at least it worked as it was wonderfully hot during our stay. Bathroom is small, there is a safe and TV is OK. Breakfast is 630-930am, standard BW fare, breakfast meats rotate, that is one day sausage, one day bacon, toast, cereal, bagels, mini muffins, scrambled eggs (powdered) yoghurt, some fruit from a tin and make your own waffles. If you like apple jelly then this is apple jelly heaven.....not much else, it was a rare find indeed to find grape or even strawberry jelly! Juice and coffee is also there as well. Hotel is right at the top end of the French Quarter, close enough to walk to the French quarter, the river front, the french outdoor market and even Harrah's and the outlet shops are only a 20 min walk. Across the road is Louis Armstrong Park, we would go across every morning to feed the ducks, dodge the squirrels and try to avoid the small population of homeless people......still a sad thing to see in 2014! The hop on hop off bus is just a 7 min walk from the hotel, through the park and you can catch it at the info center which is a converted train station and right next door is a cemetery where you can walk around and get a feel for the history, this is where the New Orleans Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau is resting. The hotel has a lounge, sometimes it is open sometimes not.......ice machine on floors 2 and 3, thats it and a crappy vending machine with some coke products in the parking garage. Pool area is nice in the court yard with lots of tables, chairs and lounges. Checkout was a challenge but we got through it, we were honest when she asked how was you stay......didnt appear she wanted to hear what we had to say......here's a tip if you dont want to know the answer dont ask the question!...my advice, you can probably do better....if not try a room away from the pool area.......our 10 year enjoyed the pool and breakfast was ok, internet was ok and overall just an average experience....but New Orleans.....well that a whole other story!",

This hotel was not in the area we thought it was in, actually it was pretty far from what we expected. As it turns out that was a good thing. We weren't to far from Ocean Beach which is a fun experience in itself, and not to far from Pacific beach as well. They provide free beach crusier rentals and we had fun taking those out to get around quicker. Now the Hotel itself is in a somewhat run down area, and there isn't anything to see unless you bike for 30 minutes but we had an adventure because of it. Downstairs as all the other review say is fun. You can play board games get a drink and hang with a mixed crowd of people while enjoying a seat by the pool. The room is average, maybe a little below. It was clean (other than stain on sheet) and for the age it was descent. But we need to point out that the age does make a difference. The bathroom is dated, and the basic feel is a converted Motel 6 into a retro style hotel. But then again we didn't stay in the room long so those facts didn't bother me. The staff was friendly and very personable which makes up for the hotels state of disaray. I would recommend this hotel if you are open minded, enjoy people and music, and like the out of the box experience that you can't have at a huge hotel. Go have an adventure, get a bike and cruise to Ocean Beach.. just doing that makes the day rememberable.. LOLThanks for the review. very good suggestion on borrowing the bikes and going for a ride. it's a great way for guest to see Pt. Loma, Downtown or Ocean Beach. we appreciate your support and hope you will come visit us again soon.",

The owner created a wonderful place with great atmosphere.Few evening every week, people are gathering around the pool, on a big screen you can see an old movie, laughing, some dancing, drink, great food and lovely people..Lets talk about people, the personnel were great, very welcoming, helping in need, and even play there part in directing a tourist like me.I am talking about everyone I met there but still I bump with some more occasionally.( and I hope I spell each the name correctlyMarcella, the night worker who woke me up every morning, and welcomed me for a coffee at the lobbyJami, The bartender who was very nice, welcome and patient with all my questionsEmily, that made us the best Mojito everThank you all for a wonderful hosting, hope to see you againIVGIThank you very much for taking time to write a very detailed review of the Pearl Hotel.

I was disappointed that you had to go to the bar to get ice and, in the evening, things can get a little loud with the patrons at the bar. Overall, I was satisfied with my accommodations, but I can't say I would stay there again for my next SD getaway. I'm not poo-pooing the place, it just wasn't for me.Thanks for the honest review. In the future you can call the front desk or bar and ask them to bring you ice, that was the thought process on not putting an ice machine on our little property. your feedback will better serve us to inform our guests that we are willing to bring ice to our guests.",

I think I would characterize The Pearl as personal and intimate. Natalie took our reservation by phone the day before then remembered us personally with a little note in the room when we arrived. David checked us in on arrival and treated us like an innkeeper greeting special guests. We had several dealings with Angie and she seemed like we were family. As a small businessman all my life I have always tried to spend my money with other small business people. If we ever make our way back to SD we will certainly 'spend our money' with The Pearl since it's so nice to feel appreciated.On behalf of the entire Pearl team, THANK YOU for your great review.

                "text": "This is a very delayed review as it was 6 months ago this week that we stayed at the Pearl Hotel. Ive never felt the urge to write a review of a hotel before, but I really wanted to for this hotel as I was so pleased we found this little gem wanted to share our experience with others thinking of staying here. 7 of us Brits (age ranges between 30 62) arrived at the Pearl late on a Sunday night in November 2010 after driving from Las Vegas. The service we received at check in was great, we were advised on where to park our car (if you park on the street round the corner, its free as opposed to paying for parking outside) were shown to our rooms. It was nearly midnight when we got our luggage out of the car into our room when we discovered a (very minor) issue with our room. We werent going to mention it to reception but thought we would bring it to their attention. Without going into lots of detail (as it would be boring!), we received the best service over our 4 day stay we have ever had on our many trips to the US from this hotel. The reception staff were fantastic in helping to resolve our problem they went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at the Pearl. You can tell this isnt a chain restaurant is a family run hotel as the little touches made a big difference to our stay. For example, they leave a note after cleaning your room each day telling you what the next days weather will be the menu for that evenings dinner at the restaurant. We were very fortunate to be offered a free meal at the hotel, to be totally honest we were hesitant at eating in the restaurant as we like to explore the local area rather than eat at our hotel for dinner. We were very pleasantly pleased at how yummy the food was, both my husband I had the burger loved it they arent lying when they claim it to be the best burger in the area! We were only disappointed that we left it till our last night to eat there as we would have had more food there had we ate there earlier. We ate in the outside little garden terrace although it was a chilly November night, it has several garden heaters that made it a nice cosy area to eat drink in. Before we headed out for the evenings, we had a few drinks in the bar the beer drinkers in our party were impressed at the wide array of lagers ales on offer. I had a lavender cocktail that I remember being very tasty indeed. There is a good seating area around the pool / cinema screen to enjoy drinks from the bar.With regards to the room, each one has its own fish tank on the wall which is something Id never seen before in a hotel I loved this detail. Between us we had 4 rooms so I got to see all rooms all were of good standard.The location is pretty good, we drove to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo Old Town none of which took that long to get to. For the evenings that we went out into San Diego, the hotel rang up for a taxi it didnt take long to reach our destination. Overall, I would rate this hotel very highly if you are thinking about booking this hotel I recommend that you do as you wont regret it. 6 months on, all 7 of us who went on the trip adored this hotel we still talk about our stay there it was a real highlight of our 2 week stay to Las Vegas, San Diego, Anaheim LA. If we ever go back to San Diego, I will make sure we stay at this hotel if anyone who works at the hotel is reading this thank you very much for the fabulous service!Thank you very much for the detailed review. Awesome!!!!! The entire staff at the Pearl was honored to have you as our guest. Your kind words are so appreciated. hope you will come stay with us again in the future. Again thank you for choosing the Pearl Hotel.",

I went online to look up the restaurant menu and fell in love with the hotel pics! Was already booked at the Sheraton (not a big fan of generic chains) but I decided to call the Pearl at the last minute and talked to the ultra fabulous, Avalon! They had a room available and I immediately cancelled my Sheraton reservation. Best decision ever! Stayed in one of the Gem rooms upstairs. Super comfortable room, great retro decor, and super clean! The room had free WIFI that worked great! The Pearl is in a great little residential neighborhood off a main street. I loved the location, which ended up being even closer to my conference location.Went downstairs and had amazing cocktails and full 3-course dinner at the bar. Bartenders were great and Chef Elliott Townsend will not disappoint. The food was DELICIOUS!! Beautiful, seasonal ingredients cooked perfectly! Will absolutely eat here again the next time in San Diego!This is a small hotel and there is no valet parking or luxury amenities. But their service more than makes up for this! They get 5 stars for service for sure! Avalon took care of everything from the moment I called. She took care my room reservation, reserved a parking space, helped with my bags, handled room service, and brought up a hotel t-shirt that I purchased. She even came outside to wait for me when I called the hotel to say I was a little lost! She provided better service than some 5-star hotel concierges I've dealt with. ATTENTION PEARL MANAGEMENT: Chef Elliott and Avalon are rock stars!!",

I, too, was suckered by the glowing reviews, but in reality, this is a refurbished motel that has cleverly marketed itself as a hip destination spot. It's located in a nondescript area of town, and the furnishings are Ikea-quality generic modern. The pool is small and filled with plastic balls, making it all but unusable. The attraction of this place seems to be the bar, which unfortunately is in an open courtyard, which means you get to hear the music all night, whether you want to or not. The crowd is young, as is the staff. If you are, too, and are on vacation, you might like this place. But don't stay here for business.",

They kindly allowed me to stash a piece of luggage there two weeks in advance of my stay and they had it waiting for me in my room upon my arrival. Check in took all of two minutes and the host was friendly and efficient. Both the wake up call and taxi I asked for were expedited without worry. The room was large enough, spotless and had a warm charm with a comfortable bed. The plumbing and shower pressure were excellent. I can't comment as to whether it was noisy since I was tired enough to have slept through anything. I got a bite to eat at the bar and the food was tasty and served up by a helpful and polite barman. If you stay at the Pearl you won't be disappointed but be aware that you'll be charged for the boxes of water you drink that are provided in your room.Thank you very, very much for your great review.

The price is too good to pass up for a place with very good reviews when compared to the other options in the vicinity of downtown. Each night the bar/restaurant on the ground floor draws an eclectic mix. The food and drinks are outstanding and the movies shown in the courtyard each Wednesday night make for a fun atmosphere.The rooms are very simple, but nice. The main issue I had was with the noise level in the room. Even with a room at the back of the building, the early morning traffic noise from the busy street on which the Pearl is located easily was enough to wake a person and keep them up. Facility parking is not free, but there is ample street parking a block away.Don't check out before trying the Brussels sprouts at the restaurant.Appreciate you taking time to leave us a review. truly appreciate your support and comments.

The Pearl was a great place to stay. Located in the quiet neighborhood of Point Loma, the Pearl is no more than a 10 minute drive to anything one would want to see in San Diego. The Pearl does offer parking but most nights of my stay I was able to find safe street parking nearby without issue. The rooms were clean, comfortable, well appointed and the staff was more than accommodating for anything that was needed. Although the hotel does not offer weekday breakfast, there are several great spots in walking distance and there is great coffee in the lobby. I would not recommend The Pearl for light sleepers who want to go to sleep early. Most rooms overlook the pool and restaurant which does create noise until about 11PM on weeknights. I personally did not mind and enjoyed the liveliness of the property but this could be an issue for light/early sleepers. Also, as The Pearl itself advertises, this is not a place for people traveling with children.Honored you chose our little gem! We LOVE people that just 'get it'. You are one groovy cat and we hope to have you back soon. Cheers!",

I booked the Essentials package, that came with free parking for your stay, two complimentary cocktails, and one appetizer. I stayed in Room 3 and everything was great! The bed was super comfortable and I had a wonderful nights sleep. The room comes with a small patio area, which in my opinion is just ok. I think it could be a little bigger and more private, but if your not going to use it then it shouldn't be a big deal to you. At the Restaurant, the bartender was awesome! He knows what he's doing and is willing to help you out. A+ for the serivce he gave. I think his name might of been John Don't quote me on that though! lol The ONLY things that I think could be improved would be the bathroom, carpeting, and mosquito problem. The carpeting in the room was almost rope like in feeling so I wore sandals when I walked around. The bathroom was not disgusting but it did look run down. There was also this strange occurance of several small mosquitos I caught flying in the room. I think they might be coming from the plants. Those problems are small and the rest of the experience was so great , I was able to overlook the little things. Don't get me wrong, I am super picky when it comes to hotels! I highly reccommend staying here. For people who are constant complainers (you know who you are) don't stay here if you want a nice quiet getaway, there is a Hilton down the way for you.thanks for the GREAT REVIEW!!!!! Super cool. Appreciate it. John is awesome. will let him know. Our staff truly goes the extra mile to create that guest experience. so glad you enjoyed it. your note about the bathroom is well taken and we are addressing it in the near future. hope you come stay with us again soon.",

                "text": "The Pearl is an extremely unique place. I do want to counter a few statements from post-reviews about the outdated feel and the ikea like furniture. It's very understandable for someone to not feel that The Pearl is up to date. The architecture of the building is old, yes, and the furniture, yes, but that's the idea behind the movement of this hotel. Seldom these days do you find such a gem that supports and honors the art of MCM. The whole idea is to feel that your living in a 1950-60's dwell magazine ad. Playing episodes of soul train in the courtyard should sell anyone. Good on you folks at The Pearl for keeping the beauty of MCM alive. The Restaurant was incredible, and the support of local and sustainable, is a breathe of fresh air. The staff are charming, funny, and all good looking. Thank you!

Our server Jesse had some great tips on visiting San Diego and was so friendly and efficient! The busser Carter was equally friendly and helpful he helped situate our chairs over by the fire for after dinner cocktails, also by the pool! Together they were about the best I've encountered. Our delicious dinners were served poolside while a James Bond movie played on the big screen and Bond music played in the background. We felt like we were in the sixties in a Bond movie in a good way! Everything was very chic and cool but also very inviting. It was also 1/2 price wine night so it was just a perfect evening. I would recommend a stop here to anyone looking for a unique dining experience. I hear the rooms are also nice but unfortunately we did not stay here.Thank you for taking the time to leave a positive review. We greatly appreciate your support! Our staff are rockstars and so glad you enjoyed their excellent service. The movie night are really fun. Hope you can return for a stay in one of our rooms. Make it a great day.",

The decor has a mod, retro, hip vibe... full of earthiness, fun, and intentionality. The staff was extremely open and friendly and quick to offer suggestions about what to see and do around town. The beer and cocktail list is great. I strongly suggest the Marie Antoinette... the hint of lavender in it made it feel fancy. They are definitely helping lead the mixology trend of infusing interesting things together for a delish beverage. The room was great. Had a great radio with their own playlist which helped us stay with the whole vibe. I still miss our little goldfish friend. The only mishap happened at Happy Hour when we weren't told that the beer we ordered wasn't included in the happy hour special... but even that was readily remedied by the owner of The Pearl. If you want a unique boutique hotel, I definitely recommend this place. It's also near to the Sunset Cliffs. We are planning to go catch one of their Wednesday night flicks soon. :)Thanks for the killer review. We appreciate it. Come stay with us again soon!!!!!! Happy Holidays from the entire Pearl Hotel crew.",

A friend referred me to The Pearl and I'm so glad she did. When I checked-in it was pretty late, and I was ready to snooze. Unfortunately, I found that my bed linens had not been changed, when I was just ready to 'hit the hay'. I am a business woman and understand that these things happen. The front desk manager ( at least I think she was the manager), Marcella, was great! She came up to my room and insisted on changing the bed herself, she apologized profusely, and made sure that I was at ease and made comfortable. We had such a pleasant conversation, that for the next ten minutes I forgot about being totally wipe-out! One person who cares about their job, has pride in their work and word, and really cares about PEOPLE, can make all the difference in the world between a pleasant and unpleasant situation! Thank you very much Marcella, the next time I'm in San Diego, I will stay at The Pearl!!!Thank you and thank you. Sorry your trip started off on the wrong foot, but you are 100 correct, One person can turn that negative into a super positive experience. Marcella is such an attribute to the Pearl Hotel. I will pass on your kind comments about her efforts. Honored to have you as our guest and hope you will come visit us again soon.

Like the fish that came with our room, Rambo. The bar is open to the pool, everything is small, but the whole hotel is small. The location was close to everything needed, coffee etc. Even though the area is older and feels more real, it felt safe. If you want to party with other hotel guests there are planned events around the bar and on Wednesday nights a dive-in movie.Cons - Our shower was very sad, to get hot water we ended up with not much more than a trickle. The flip side of the activities around the pool is the noise level which blended in with our extremely noisy air conditioner. Overall we were glad that we stayed. Our check-in was done by Megan who was lovely,warm and welcoming.Thank you for taking the time to write a mighty fine review. Feedback is so important to us. We are constantly striving to make the Pearl experience stellar! Rambo sends his love and hopes to have you back. Make it a great day!",

The problem is they want to be a hip cool bar/restaurant/hotel, but it is so loud!!! You can't have lots of fun in the courtyard and not bug hotel guests. OR do a better job of encouraging hotel guests to participate in activities. I really enjoyed my first night here so much--bed was very comforatable, loved the mod renovations amd the beta fish. I booked again for another night the latter part of my trip. I didnt' want same room again (17) because a/c squeaked badly and the curtain covered the unit. However, 17 was a cooler room than the room I stayed in, but prefered the a/c unit in the second room. Liked that there was lots of white noise to help drown out the street/bar noise. Stayed on a Thurs and there was a crazy bingo game--it is LOUD. You can hear the banging around of the other guests. Knowing now about bingo night, I wouldn't stay here again on a Thurs. It is a really good concept and people were having lots of fun, but noise carries here.Thank you for your review and feedback. Point well taken on our 1 night a month Bingo game. Very sorry for the noise challenge. We will be doing 2 things as we move forward. 1 is do a better job notifying our guests of our events and 2 to minimize the noise via stopping the bingo game earlier. I do appreciate your nice comments about our staff they do care and truly enjoy serving our guests. Hope you will come stay with us again soon.",

I am very familiar with the property, as I live nearby, and stop in for a drink or dinner frequently. Point Loma is an often undiscovered part of San Diego, especially by tourists. Those in the know understand that some of our cities best gems are located on the peninsula, one of which is The Pearl. I recently hosted my company's holiday party here, and it was fantastic. It all starts with the venue, The Pearl surprises people because from the street most people have no idea what lies inside. Inside you'll find a lovingly restored motor lodge that brings back the spirit of 60's mid-century modern with some modern polish. That is complemented by a great bar and restaurant where you can find great cocktails, and unique food served by staff who are truly invested in what they do.I'll be the first to say that I prefer hotels, restaurants, and bars that have a point of view, and that are sometimes a bit quirky. If that's what you are looking for check out The Pearl.Thanks for acknowledging the Pearl for the great venue that it is, plus Point Loma!!!. is a great community. sometimes tourist overlook it, but it has lots and lots to offer.

We had a drink and then went to our room (23), a little worried if it would be loud, and were pleasantly surprised that it was not.

                "text": "Having visited San Diego before and not necessarily enjoying the Gas Lamp District (with it's chain restaurants and conference going visitors), I was excited to discover the hip Pearl Hotel in Point Lomo. When you tally up it's affordable price, friendly customer service, inviting bar and pool area, and overall design, it's clear you have an excellent choice when staying in San Diego.The hotel is a short five minute drive from San Diego Airport, about fifteen minutes to downtown or Balboa Park, and conveniently located next to a Starbucks, grocery store, and the harbor on Shelter Island. Limited on-site parking is available for a reasonable 10 a night although it's probably best to ask the hotel to reserve a spot for you.The hotel itself is a converted motel with just over 20 rooms situated around a small pool. The main check-in area and bar feature a hip lobby and modern looking bar which also serves as a place to grab a bite to eat in the evening and a cup of coffee in the morning.The rooms while retaining that mid-century motel layout are remodeled with clean bathrooms, a comfortable bed, and a trendy design. A nice twist is that each room features a goldfish which adds a nice human touch. Our first floor room let in a little more noise than I expected from the common areas, but by midnight when staff were tidying up and closing the bar, there was little noise to keep you up.While we did run into an issue during our stay, the staff were extremely helpful and pro-active in making sure we left on a good foot. Had they stopped there, I would still have written a positive review but their follow up call and gesture proves that this is a well managed hotel that truly cares about their customers.On behalf of the entire Pearl management and staff, thank you for taking the time to leave a kind and detailed review! We truly appreciate it. Your support means the world to us. Please come visit us again soon. Tell a friend.",

The entire staff was friendly and Our room was clean and basic, and our pet goldfish Betty was fun touch.We had drinks and small plates at Eat at The Pearl's happy hour when we initially arrived. The food was fine, and the drinks were good.The concept of The Pearl is great, but it is starting to look shabby, especially around the pool area. Also, it's obvious this place is a hangout for locals that are not staying in the hotel. It didn't seem like a vacation friendly pool for those staying, but more like a locals only party pool. Now I'm all for a fun party vibe, I've stayed at Ace hotels many times, but it did seem to us that local peeps took over the place, and because of that, we didn't feel like hanging out. This was a little disappointing, as our Strand room was not exactly inexpensive.Thank you for taking the time to leave a review and for all of your feedback! Since we pack a lot into our little gem, our restaurant and bar surround our pool, so when we have brunch guests (Hotel and local) join in the FUN! We apologize if you felt unwelcome in the pool, we would never want our guests to feel that way! Thanks again for your feedback and I'm happy to hear that our staff delivered on service. Cheers!",

We each got a drink on the house. They reopened their restaurant with some new foods. I wasnt a fan, but Im a more casual eater, I didnt even know what somethings were. The decor is charming: a swan floaty in the pool, a vertical succulent garden, chiminea in the corner, twinkling lights, bamboo for privacy, Betta fish in every room. There were a couple snafus but they handled it nicely. Id go back.",

                "text": "Walked into the room and it was small and sparsely furnished but, I guess there really was no room for a table. The A/C-Heat was the typical in that it had 2 temperatures (arctic and sauna) and nothing in between. The TV was difficult to turn off and on. There was only 1 glass in the entire room. The toilet had to be jiggled to stop running. This room was across the hall from a storage room and there seemed to be constant noise all the time. It seemed to be a novel way to turn a run down motel into a boutique hotel with a few contemporary furnishings that could not disguise the fact that it was an old motel. The tub had numerous gouges in it and you could see daylight threw the door (great insulation). We were charged an extra 10 to park and after returning from going out to dinner all the hotels spots were taken and we had to park 3 blocks away. We checked out and were never asked how our stay was or even thank you for staying with us. Will not be returning or recommending this hotel to friends or family.Good day and Happy Holidays. In receipt of your review. Very sorry you were disappointed with your experience. all of your comments are noted and will be discussed with management. Our entire Pearl team always strives to improve our guest experience and property. Make it a fantastic day.",

                "text": "Arriving into San Diego, GPS has me going down this scrappy looking strip dotted with low-end motels, convenience and liquor stores. Right away, I am chiding myself for relying only on T.A. and not talking with locals before booking the non-refundable special here. By the neighborhood's appearance I was certain I'd erred. The Pearl's unassuming exterior belies the treasures within. Upon walking into the courtyard/pool area, I met two cute and perky young gals at front desk who introduced me to Greg, the owner. I know I had a dubious look on my face as I began to question him about the clientele here, the noise level, the neighborhood, etc. Greg assured me this was a popular locals place for bar/dining, a favorite lodging place for an older crowd and young families, and not a wild partying venue. While he could have said, you will LOVE this place instead he was matter of fact, polite and reassuring. Upon entering the room, I knew I'd hit the jackpot....and within 5 minutes I found Greg at poolside with his co-workers, as I exclaimed, I LOVE this place! The room's retro dcor, cleanliness, ultra-modern touches and amenities set the stage for the ultimate in mid-century motif - right down to Jaws the lone fish swimming in a bowl mounted to the wall. At 4-6 Happy Hour, the relaxed and festive bar came alive with such friendly patrons and accommodating, crisp hotel staff. Between the hum of the AC and an incredibly comfortable bed, both nights of sleep were blissful. The restaurant is divine. I sat on the shag-covered pad by the lobby with a tray table as it was full for Valentine's prix fixe dinner. Service and food were superb. The feeling of pride among the staff in the care of the Pearl and its guests is palpable. While the location is a bit inconvenient to downtown, Point Loma is close by for spectacular views, and after a day of Balboa Park and sites in the city, it is a welcome retreat to return here. So, I will ONLY book at the Pearl on subsequent SD trips and sing its praises to anyone I know heading this way for holiday.",

It has a lot of appeal due to the access to fun areas around San Diego. The price is right, too!There was a drawback to the location that my husband states will be the reason we won't go back. The road noise and traffic on Rosecrans forced us to seek out ear plugs and the only way to watch TV was on a high volume. We didn't feel 100 safe walking to and from coffee shops, etc. In fact, someone leaving a driveway paid no attention to us at all. Everyone on Rosecrans is in some kind of hurry. Not the laid back beach town vibe I was looking for.If you are young and hip enough to pass out with a buzz after the fun bar and pool experience, the road noise may not be a bother.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. Happy to hear you enjoyed our little gem. Unfortunately, some of our rooms do get the road noise, but we always recommend requesting one of our quieter rooms, so that you may have a peaceful night OR there is always your great suggestion of a nitecap or two in our bar :) Thanks again for taking the time to write a review.",

I didn't know about the 10 parking charge, but there's plenty of neighborhood parking. Also, this was a great way to avoid the downtown/Gaslamp district party scene and expensive parking.

We stayed in room no. 9 which was a junior suite. Great, vintage couch. Goldfish named Bruce Lee on the wall. Patio. Air conditioning. The location is away from downtown in an area called Point Loma that has good restaurants (walking)and the Cabrillo National Monument Area nearby (driving). There are even some bayside beaches. I swam at one and it seemed pretty clean. And the pool at the Pearl is small but great. Drinks and music poolside! We pretty much had it to ourselves twice. It also has its own restaurant but we didn't eat there. Near the airport, too, but we drove in.Downside: my wife disliked the hard bed intensely. The traffic noise from the street is loud. Parking is limited and ten bucks extra. No guarantee you'll get a spot. Far from downtown and no trolley nearby. Pillows were absurdly uncomfortable! Go figure. That sounds like an oxymoron: uncomfortable pillows. My wife complained that there was no full-length mirror. Oh, well. More upside than downside in my book.

                "text": "I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so. First, the hotel is beautiful. Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer. Rooms are a bit pricey, but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville. In fact,... Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks. The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus. We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that, too, was a great location site. It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom, I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it. I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotel's event planner. While she sets up everything for you (or instructs the staff, I'm not entirely sure), I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit. My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided. Also, my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception. The hotel's planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items. The hotel's planner is not consistently present during the reception, especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel. She is present only here and there, but not consistently. We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotel's planner or anyone to help. Overall, the hotel's planner was useful in organizing the details, planning food, etc. She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be. At times, communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed. The overall package price, in my opinion, was helpful. Next, we had issues with the clean up of the event, which is part of the package. The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor, which resulted in my DOC, father, and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my father's room. As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception, there was no one to talk to about what was happening. Needless to say, the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride. After some pressing to the Westin, compensation was given for this. I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing. For reception food, it was fantastic. We had many compliments on the steak, sides, etc. The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick. My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric. Eric is a jack of all trades - he was the bartender at the rehearsal, bell hop at various points, waiter at the reception, van driver on Sunday. If you have Eric doing anything, you are in good hands. We also had a fantastic server, JJ, at the wedding - we loved her, too. The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver. In the end, this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar. You are charged taxes, gratuity, and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package; this was an issue and I'm still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned. Think twice about this option. Most of our decor was returned - a few items were missing.",

The lobby, the elevator and our room had various smells of smoke, body odor, curry and feet!! Daily housekeeping service is only available if you stay for a week ... unless you want to pay 15/day for it. The towels are hard, scratchy and very thin ... and the toilet paper is the same. In our full kitchen, we had 1 fork and 3 spoons. The coffee maker was on it's last leg ... and we only had 1 packet of coffee with ancient creamer whose powder was so hard it didn't even melt in the coffee. The continental breakfast was 3 thermos of coffee, a basket of apples, and stale muffins and is located on a table right next to the front door, which caused a traffic jam with people trying to get in/out of the hotel in the morning. On a positive note, the hotel staff was pleasant, the bed was nice and the location is good. Otherwise, this hotel is definitely not worth the money!!",

The room was really nice and the staff was very accomodating. The hotel is very clean. We got stuck in traffic for 3 hrs in indiana on the way to the hotel and I called to let them know we wouldn't be there until midnight rather than 9pm. they checked me in over the phone, it was simple and took less than 2 minutes. The free breakfast is fruit, tea, coffee, water, and granola but it's free so no complaining. :) the room was bigger than I expected considering we were in downtown. The location cannot be beat! It was like 5 blocks from Willis tower and if you walk to the right from the hotel, you run straight into millennium park! The famous Chicago theater is just 3 blocks away. Hard rock cafe and portillos are like 7 blocks. Giordanos is also pretty close. Actually, everything is close. We did not pay to park at the hotel but parked at a garage across the street which was cheaper. It was less like 80 for the weekend, we parked our car and didn't drive again until we drove home. It's pretty easy to find the hotel and pretty easy to get back to the highway too.",

From our arrival we were greeted by Benny, the Bell Captain who along with the rest of his Bell staff took care of us from go. We were allowed to check in early to a Junior Suite 102 which had a beautiful view of the Ocean located at the end of the street. Our suite was located out in a building separate from the main hotel and off the pool area. Just around the corner from the front desk. Our suite was large had a separate sitting area with a flat screen TV and a small fridge under the counter which had plenty of cabinet space. 2 sinks one in the bathroom and one in the counter where the fridge was. Luxurious Bathrobes that I ABSOLUTELY wanted (will put on my birthday list :) Bellman Dan scooted us over to a local restaurant in the hotel golf cart... they will offer to take you just about anywhere and will also return to pick you up.rnrnService at the Front Desk was exceptional, friendly, courteous and consistently above and beyond helpful! I commend who ever does the hiring here because they have done a Fantastic job of hiring people that either love their job and sincerely want you to enjoy your stay or they do a great job in faking it LOLrnrnHotel is located within walking distance of all the quaint shops, it has it's own restaurant but we were not impressed with the menu... we did however take advantage of the happy hour deal the appetizers were tasty and 1/2 off as was their signature cocktail Orange Crush. The day before the boyfriend ordered a Cloud 9 that was the BOMB! and I got my favorite Lemon Drop both were flavorful but I must say this was the only place I was not impressed with the Bar Service it took a while for our appetizers to arrive and they were not as attentive as the rest of the hotel staff had been /rnrnAll and all a very nice place to drop in during the week we get the impression that weekends here (like most places) are a zoo. Parking on the street down the hill is free so don't spend the 22.00 on valet just find a spot on the street.rnrnRespectfully Reviewedrn",

                "text": "Pacific Shores has the nearby beach going for it. That said, if you want to be more centrally located to the main San Diego area you may be disappointed here. It is just off of Pacifc Beach which is directly North of Mission beach. They are both just North of Mission Bay and Sea World. That means they are also well North of the San Diego harvour area, the downtown and Blaboa Park. We found the drive to Sea World to be easy with routes to Mission Bay right down Mission Boulvard or over Grand Street to Ingrahm Ave. We tried the beach both off of the motel at pacific beach and down near Belmont Park on Mission beach. The Mission beach area is a little better for kids. Both are well patroled by lifeguards and the ocean surf is warm and fun to play in. We spent three nights at Pacific Shores. The motel is going through some growing pains with upgrading going on. One afternoon after returnign from the beach we were kept oput of returnign to our room while maintenance was replacing a light switch with sensor switch. This was late in the afternoon at a time when they should expect the guests may want to return to thier rooms. The timing was bad. The last night we spent the smoke alarm batery gave out around midnight and the device began emitting loud alarms. A call to thew dsk brought someont tot eh room aroun 1:00AM, We had to small boys with us trying to sleep. The man replaced the bsattery in the smoke dector and wehn away. A hald horu later it began letting off a short blast every hour or so for the rest of the night! We has a restless night and the kids were not happy. Complaining to the manager lead to the expalnation that the battery was probably not put in properly, sorry about that. No adjustment was offered on our rate but he did say if we come back again to call him and he would give us a better rate next time. Overall while the location may be out of the way to some we enjoyed the proximity of the beaches, the overall casual atmosphere of the area. The motel manager also mentioned that upgrades are planned to replace the pool area and improve the overall motel. The cost is reasonable, the weather is always great and if that darn smoke alarm goes off put the battery in yourself!",

The shower has a rain forest shower head plus a wand on a hose. The lighting in the bathroom is excellent.

There was also some water leakage from the shower which had damage the lower door area. I thought i saw traces of mold but I tried not to think about that. I made a note of it when I checked out.

The hotel is just a minute walk to the beach and few minutes from the pier. The breakfast was just ok with muffins, croissants, tea, coffee and juices , just for takeaway as theres no place to sit and eat. The only thing that sucked was the WiFi .

The clerk tried blaming it on the booking company and then told me I should have booked through the hotel directly and that it was my fault for using a booking company. However I'm prerty sure the hotel jusy over booked on purpose. She didn't offer me any help at all so my 3 kids and I were stranded in an unfamiliar town with no where to go and a dying cell phone. She didn't offer any apology nor did she offer to call other hotels to help us find a room or offer any kind of information about where to go. Worst customer service ever. Stupidly small parking lot (that does not look safe at all). I would avoid this hotel!!!! We ended up going to a hotel close to this one (Pacific View Inn.....NOT to be confused with the Pacific Shores Inn)....even though that hotel was full too, the man working there took the time to help me out and made some great suggestions. I do apologize for the mistake of my hotel and your reservation. I will stress the importance of taking care of every person, whether a guest or not.

I was not thrilled with the change as I had spent many hours pondering, looking at pictures, maps, and reviews on the internet before making the selection. When we arrived and saw the room, it was nice enough, but you could tell it was only halfway remodeled. There we obvious upgrades, nice BIG new TV, nice little fridge and microwave, however the old curtains were still up, and the floor was carpeted, not tiled. The bathroom was upgraded, but also unfinished, as the shower grout and chalking was not finished around the bottom....which allowed water flow out the shower, under the wall and into the carpet in the room. We discovered this as our socks got soaked as we walked into the bathroom across the soggy carpet.Front desk was very helpful. When we turned our TV on, there was no cable. When we called the front desk, she cheerfully came down and immediately found the problem, the cable was not plugged into the TV. She also told us to let management know about the leaky shower when we checked out...which we did, and they got us a reasonable discount.The location is superb! It's a couple minutes walk to the beach, and there is a nice grassy park above the beach on the little bluff with great views. Many reasonably priced restaurants in walking distance.We will be back, and hope to get a fully finished room...at which point the review will be 4 or 5 instead of 3!Of course, we would love to receive a 5! But, I do understand your issues, and I believe I met you while I was picking up some paperwork at the desk. Please just give me a call the next time, and we'll make sure you get a fully renovated room! Thank you! And, btw, we did take care of the issues you told us about! Thank you.",

The beach is beautiful and the location of the hotel is just one short block from the beach. You are charged for Wifi, the breakfast is pastry and coffee tea with creamora, the rooms are dated, and the air- conditioning is noisy. We just used the fan since the nights were cool to drown out the noise. I have stayed at other dated hotels with no air-conditioning, maybe I expected more. They did have complimentary parking and the bathrooms were clean. There was also a pool but when you have an ocean steps away, why botherYes, I guess a few of our rooms are dated, but they will all be new by this time next year, and we have already renovated about half. Each room is different when it comes to a/c noises, and we try to keep up with repairs for the big compressors we have located in our back alley. I hope you will try us again the next time you are here in San Diego. Also, our rates are very competitive in the off-season. Thank you!",

The staff is super friendly and helpful. The downsides were room size (small and bathroom painfully small!), lack of outlets for charging, and questionable housekeeping/cleaning. If the indoor pool is a draw - do not book here for that! The pool is small and really dirty. It seems that residents book on weekends to let the kids use the pool. It was really loud with kids running and jumping into a 3 ft pool and hot tub. Disappointing if you are traveling with kids who are looking forward to some pool time on vacation.Thank you for staying at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown and for taking the time to share your feedback. We are extremely proud that our staff were able to make your stay an enjoyable one. It's also nice to know our convenient location and closeness to the Historic District, with many restaurants and shopping venues close by, made your stay even better.

Our staff is passionate about providing guests with the cleanest facilities, so we are checking into the situation now to see where we failed.

No customer should be inconvenienced at all either!!!!!! We left Bay Inn Suites up the street since it looked like a Motel 6 thrown up, that was totally misleading internet information. Again, no one should have to deal with parking their car when they are paying customer ever. Let's clean it up especially around the area by some type of vending machine or something, pretty trashy there so that next time I come it looks 100 better.We are very grateful of your feedback. Thank you for staying with us during your recent trip to San Diego.We apologize for the parking issues you experienced and we will take your suggestions into consideration. Unfortunately as we are located in a central location of such a busy city, parking is often hard to find. Many other properties in the area have begun charging a fee for parking as a solution to this dilemma. With that being said, we agree that our guests should not have trouble finding parking while staying at our accommodations. We are glad our night manager was able to help out but we will continue searching for a solution to this. We hope you consider staying with us again.",

Our team believes in being proactive and we glad you felt our advance preparation for the power outage was quite professional. With that said, it's great to know that our immaculate accommodations and tile floors met your expectations for a pleasant stay.

We are very sorry to hear you experienced anything other than friendly and courteous service during your stay.

It was very close to nearby attractions such as Sea World and Mission Beach. There were also markets and stores nearby if you need any essentials. I also enjoyed nearby places to eat that were local eats at reasonable prices. Another plus was that I was able to get 2 queen beds at the same price as 1 King. Also, no charge for parking.I didn't like how the towels were stained and dirty. The room was musty and the AC unit was under the window so whenever the fan was blowing, the curtains would fly up. The breakfast was minimal with different breads and pastries and bananas.Thank you for choosing to stay with us during your recent visit to San Diego. We consider all guest feedback to be an opportunity to improve and we really appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts. We agree that we are ideally located near SeaWorld and other attractions and entertainments. We strive to provide our guests with clean, comfortable accommodations at an affordable price. We apologize that upon arrival you found your room to be musty. We encourage our guests to let us know if they have any issues while they are staying with us so we can ensure to make the appropriate amends. In the future, we hope you choose to stay with us again and give us the chance to provide a wonderful experience.",

Other noise makers were the garbage truck is there at 7:00 am and someone was running a jack hammer around the same time. The curtain was ripped. Trim limbs falling on cars. The pastries for the continental breakfast were stale and only bananas were there for the fruit. Coffee taste like old motor oil.Dear Janet,Thank you for taking a moment to provide your valuable feedback. We would like to apologize that your stay did not meet your expectations or our standards. We are truly sorry the outside noise level was distracting. We will certainly look into your concerns regarding breakfast and the parking lot tree limbs as our goal is to provide each guest with a safe and enjoyable experience.
