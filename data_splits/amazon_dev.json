Nope, it really doesn't brush anything.<br /><br />- Bristles are weak, arrived bent<br />-Maaaaybe could work if you have super thin hair<br />- Thin and flimsy feeling if that's a concern<br /><br />I use \"wet\" hairbrushes that are designed like this, and I have to say that the quality really varies. I have a couple that I love and work wonderfully--brushes tangled wet hair painlessly, evenly brushes hair to tie it up. I've only tried 4 brands, but this is the worst I've seen. The bristles are weak--they're really thin, even for wet brushes, and they arrived bent (not because it was used--it was in the plastic wrap and everything). I do have thick hair, but this is the first brush I've used (of ANY kind--tiny travel ones included) that feels like it's literally going on top of my hair and not through it at all, even when I try to press down. It maaay work if you have thin hair, but I mean really thin hair, and even them I'm doubtful.<br /><br />I bought this hoping I could use it as a travel brush, so I wasn't too picky as long as it brushed relatively okay. Obviously not, but the plastic is also lighter and thinner than I expected it to be, again, even for a small travel brush, so I'm doubtful it or the hinge wouldn't break easily with pressure while trying to brush thick or tangly hair.",

Initially my braid lady did not think it was gonna be enough hair for my entire head but it turned out being more than enough in which I had one bag of hair left over. I recommend this product.",

I loved it so much I ordered more of the same colors but allowed more length (didn't cut in half) but trimmed for the the second two images.

It charges fine, and turns on and off\u2026 just stopped working out of no where. I opened it months after purchasing because I had a previous one and really after only 2 months of usage\u2026 it no longer works. I\u2019m disappointed and mad because regardless of the price, it\u2019s money lost and not like the seller is trying to help. I wrote to them already and no one ever got back to me!! \ud83d\ude21<br /><br />I might as well spend more money on something that is going to last longer\u2026 so off to Target I go.

It was amazing for the first month and a half. I really needed an easier way to floss with braces. I've struggled with the health of my teeth all of my life, and this product seemed like a godsend.<br /><br />It only took a little over a month for the device to no longer charge. I'd leave it plugged in, but the light would still be flashing to indicate it was charging after several hours. I'd remove it from the charger, thinking it had enough of a charge to do its job, only for it to flash red to indicate the battery was low.<br /><br />Awfully convenient that this product stops working just a little while after it's too late to get a refund. This is devastating for me, personally. I don't have enough money to purchase one of these that would actually be worth investing in, so now I'll be spending an extra half an hour in my bathroom struggling to get floss around my braces until I can afford a replacement.<br /><br />This is so discouraging for an adult who has been trying to repair her smile for a huge part of her life.

This is a very good product, by the way. It has several levels  of power BUT quite sensitive to the touch of the control buttons. Be prepared to lower the power as needed or water will fly all over!

It took me a day or so to get used to the size as it is a little larger than I'd imagined, but the 300 ml water storage is precisely what is needed to do a thorough job.

Love the packaging- I'm a sucker for a nice glass jar; it also makes it easy to use every last bit. As someone who loathes waste, I appreciated also the jar is filled to the top with product. I like the ingredients list, lots of good stuff for oily, congestion prone skin. I've come to appreciate having oily skin as it's kept fine lines at bay, but it's still a pain to deal with, just not as much as dryness. My skin felt so clean after using this, and actually had more of a matte finish- usually I'm still gleaming shiny after washing my face. It doesn't say how long to leave it on, and says you can use as an overnight spot treatment which I will try during my next breakout. As a mask, I left it on about 10 min. It did have a very light tingle to me. If you have oily skin, you will love this mask!",

It does have a strong tea tree smell to it so if you don\u2019t like that it may not be for you but personally I love the smell and tingle it gives. Be sure to moisturize well after rinsing, as it can be drying (YES even if you have acne - balancing moisture is a vital part of the process!) You can also use it as a spot treatment overnight and it will shrink your pimple and reduce the redness. DO NOT POP YOUR PIMPLES! I can\u2019t explain this enough to people, but it will damage the skin and leave scarring, especially when it\u2019s not ready and/or done with your bare hands - that allows bacteria into the pore and will further irritate the healing process. There are many different types of acne, and some you just should never pop. If you can\u2019t afford to get to a dermatologist, you can always visit a local cosmetology school. They may be able to give you some ideas on what products to use, and can safely extract a pimple if needed. It\u2019s affordable & will save you a LOT of money on micro needling or laser treatments down the road. I\u2019m just telling you from experience ;)",

Granted, it is labeled as a wax, so I expected it to be a little stiffer and to provide more hold.  But it's so hard in the can, I had to use a hair dryer to get it to soften up enough to be able to apply it.  Melting it by rubbing your hands together...good luck with that.  I tried it a couple of times and easily concluded this is definitely NOT what I was looking for.  The scent is fine and not too strong.  I'm moving on to another product...one that I don't have to heat up with a hair dryer for several minutes before I can apply it.",

Clay masks typically reduce oil and tighten enlarged pores but this one does neither significantly. I\u2019ve used better clay masks than this one.

Well stop looking, because here they are!!! #TakeNotes<br />Likes...<br />1. This set has six colors and they all have many different shapes and sizes to choose from!<br />2. The flatback makes them easy to glue and hold in place.<br />3. You can choose from small round shapes to larger star, heart or diamond shapes. AND...<br />4. To make it easy to grab and place your rhinestones, a flat L-shaped tweezer with a pointy end is included.<br />Room for improvement:<br />You need to buy glue, it's not included. #DontForget<br />The cute shapes are not the same for each color...I got only one black star, one green heart, and one beautiful iridescent oblong diamond. Also, the cute shapes are all larger sizes and take up lots of space on my short nails.<br />Lastly, the white pencil is not waxy, and didn't pick up the rhinestones, but I didn't need it.<br />OKAY, STOP SCROLLING... THIS IS IT! You cannot go wrong with this set. It should be in your collection, I am happy it's in mine. Raise your hand if you #PutEmInTheCart !!!!<br />#LetsHeadToCheckout  #ClassIsDismissed",

This tool has shaved SO much time off my normal makeup routine, gives me beautiful more natural looking brows AND is great quality. HIGHLY re<br />commend this to anyone. I was on the fence about ordering for several months and wish I would have purchased months ago when I first saw it advertised! My new favorite product.<br /><br />I was really happy with my purchase. The color matches great and I am very satisfied with my decision because I was on the fence about it for a while but I think it was well worth the money and such a time saver.Super easy to apply . I was soo surprised. Making me feel confidence in minutes! It honestly exceded my expectations. Using this kit daily now and the stencil tools are a great varity of brows.

I've never been a person into alot of make up just very simple and I've always wanted my brows to look as nice as other girls I seen and I finally can say I have those brows!  it is definitely a game changer for me. My brows looks flawless and it literally comes with everything you need. All instructions on how to use and different brow shapes and sizes.

I have thin hair but a lot of it and it's long and not one strand gets wet if I don't want it to. It doesn't slide off...the elastic keeps it in place. It's made from a material that seems to last. Durable. Over one full month using this off and on and I have no issues. It's still complete and has no rips or tears. It feels like a thick bag....or like a lighter version of a pool liner. Sturdy. Cleaning it is easy. I actually don't put mine in the washer and dryer. I just hand wash at the sink if I need to which I don't really.

The fit is good but can be adjusted with some cutting. Doesn't comprise the integrity of the lash band. I can wear one pair several times before needing to dispose them. It's a lot of lashes and the possibility of many lash looks. After a month I still have so much to continue to work with before I need to reorder.

Only if my hair is already up tightly and tucked away would I use this shower cap! I've noticed the fabric personally makes me hotter, trapping all the heat in... but I tend not to take long showers with a cap anyway; it's more utilitarian!

                "text": "Starting off this is my first experience with magnetic lashes and false lashes in general. Never liked the idea of glue but wanted to try these.<br />No clue if I'm doing it right, I followed these instructions, multiple YouTube tutorials, tons of trial and error.<br />I like that there's a variety of different styles but I can't tell which are supposed to be on what eye. They are idental on both ends on both lashes in each pair.<br />The tweezers honestly seem useless to me as they're metal so the lashes stick to them which complicates all this lol.<br />The eyeliners provided aren't ideal (I do felt tip) but usable. I tried thin line, thick line. Didn't seem to matter when putting them on. There's no way to adjust them once they're placed though, the liner comes off with the lashes which kinda sucks for a newbie like me. It also makes them hard to clean and reapply so I've moved onto different ones if I have to take it off.<br />Not sure if I'm doing it wrong. They don't seem to adhere as well to the outer corners. Also possibly they're too long for me but not exactly sure these kind can be trimmed as they only have 5 long magnets (2 being at the ends)<br />One magnet came off one pair and stayed stuck on the packaging base they come on. Kinda bummed because those were the least extreme ones. (Wanted to get used to the simple ones before going bigger/fluffier/longer).<br /><br />Overall the cost was not bad for experimenting. Am gonna look at ones in stores closer to see if any maybe have more/smaller magnets.",

Having said that, the tape at the bottom of the lashes is much to thick and actually scratchy on the eyelids.  Both tubes of eyeliner are much too thick and the brushes are awful.  The liner takes forever to dry (something all brands seem to have in common) but the magnets are great and really hold well.  The lashes themselves are mostly very theatrically cheap looking, like something you'd see at Halloween.  There are a few that are doable during the day but again, they aren't comfortable.<br /><br />Overall, they are doable and the price is right but really , the average user will probably only get use out of maybe two pair and would find a better deal with better made lashes.",

This means more of the liquid foundation seeps into the brush/is kind of wasted. But overall, it still worked really well. I think brushes are a much better alternative to fingers and I like the smooth, blended look it created.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the handle wasn't the stiffest... so I ended up holding it pretty high up on the handle, but that wasn't really a problem.",

When it arrived, I was immediately pleased with the silky interior, although there were a few loose threads.  These were not really an issue.  The cap was loose and comfortable, to the point I was not sure it would stay on during sleep or that my hair would stay contained.  Neither proved to be an issue.  I slept in it easily, my hair stayed in place, and I even wore it under my shower cap in the mornings to keep from getting the dreaded impression across my forehead from the shower cap elastic.  It worked really well, although I would recommend not splashing the face area if you choose to do this. The style issue I mentioned was that the way mine was cut, it did not look like a turban at all no matter how I turned it or tucked the corners in, but rather looked more like a cap with two edges. Not super attractive to be honest.  Hubby knew better than to do more than quietly give me a hard side eye the first time I wore it to bed though.  For the price point, this is a very comfortable and functional item. It is worth a try to see if it works for you to keep your hair looking great and save you time in the morning.",

Right out the pack the hair had a very textured feel. I thought washing it would help. The water turned a nasty brown color  and the hair still felt rough. So I conditioned it for a while and let it air dry. Air drying it only revealed how super dry this hair is. I bought it because it was the only vendor that would get to me same day. I regret not researching further and on YT. A total waste of money. I dont think this hair will last past 2 weeks before it becomes a matted mess!!!",

Bipin's production criteria and list of ingredients were both in keeping with what I seek in this type of product.  I know that some people are put off by the words \"made in China\" but I've learned that does not automatically mean a poor quality product or an ineffective one.  And while this gel might not be the right one for everybody else, it is working for me and even better than the one it replaced.<br /><br />I thought it reasonably priced.  It was carefully shrink-wrapped to avoid any leakage, bottled in convenient size (box of two), and neither too runny nor too thick in consistency.  Some reviewers mention an odor or aroma of some kind but I detected no such thing.  Initially it seemed a bit wet in application but then was fully absorbed after a few seconds and left no sticky or gummy feeling whatsoever.  This is a dream come true for my skin which seems to have become drier and more sensitive with age.  I have used it frequently over several days and have passed the point where I'd encounter a bad reaction so I'm more confident now that I made the right choice.  Too soon to tell if it will have a lasting positive impact but thus far, everything is in the plus column.",

The compartment also easily falls apart -- though again it is meant to fall apart, but I think this is an issue with the quality of the plastic. Granted, this is at a cat shelter, so for one or two cats at home it should be more than manageable.<br /><br />As for why I'm using past tense, that's because we had to get rid of it because another volunteer left it open and one of the cats peed on it, which is obviously not the manufacturers' fault. It did convince me to get another one in this style, though a pricier and (hopefully) better quality one.",

                "text": "I am surprisingly happy with this purchase! I bought this wig because at my age, my hair is starting to break really easy & I seem to be shedding much more hair than usual. I usually go with wearing hair extensions but that is sometimes pretty hard on my already weakened hair. First of all, I have to mention that this wig is exactly as pictured. Color & all. I bought this wig in this style because I needed something to wear while doing physical duties at home & when I'm out & about. I usually don't buy synthethic wigs because most of the time you can tell that they are synthetic & end up looking just horrible. But I do have to say that this wig looks like & feels almost like real human hair, at least in my opinion. It is definitely a higher end synthetic, however I am not able to curl the hair at all. But that wasn't a big deal. The hair has plenty of waviness to it & I love the braids & the ponytail. I did trim it a bit  (about 3.5 inches) because it felt a bit heavy for me. I brushed it out & added a few more braids & redid the ponytail & it looks & feels great! But my head does get a little hot when wearing it & sometimes I get a bit itchy but I think that could be because I am new to wearing wigs & maybe just need to get used to it. Not sure. I also got this wig because it seems that Copper colored ones are not as abundant as the other colors out there & was in desperate need of this color. And what I love most about this wig is the price! For $20, I figured it was worth a try. Glad I did. Definitely a must have if you only need it for a costume party or for Comic-con. Not sure I am able to wear this wig all day everyday. Am still new to exploring the world of wigs so I am still on the hunt for Copper colored hair pieces, especially one I can wear all day, everyday & be able to curl & change the the hairstyles.",

It\u2019s like.. impossible just to clip off the skin you want to clip. There\u2019s too dull & too sharp. There\u2019s a perfect in between that isn\u2019t dangerous. These are wayyyyyy too sharp. You\u2019re going to end up taking off too much skin & getting infections.  There\u2019s a reason why $12-$20 cuticle cutters work so well.. & why they cost that much.. there\u2019s a level of detail that needs to be put into these products to make sure they\u2019re safe for all people to use & it costs<br />More money & takes more time\u2026 therefore costing a bit more. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d by these again. I like the metal tool that comes with this item.. so I\u2019m going to keep them. But these will not be used on my skin.

I put some cuticle eliminator on, waited the 45 seconds, and went to work on pushing back my cuticles.  I've used a bamboo pusher before and might switch back to those if I can't get the angle of this sharp product just right.  Both ends are sharp.  They did not sand the rounded edge as I would expect.  When I went to push the cuticle back it repeatedly gouged into my natural nails causing ridges.  I haven't done this in a very long time, but I know had I used a better brand or the bamboo stick style, I wouldn't have had to spend 45 minutes buffing my nails out so they didn't look worse than when I started.",

It's sturdy, perfect weight, and rounded so even ergonomically it's solid. I've gotten hours of use out of it and still haven't encountered any issues. A lot of comb teeth are also on the sharp side, not this one, it's great. Slightly rounded teeth, so I'm sure it's not going to be hard on your pets skin. I'll likely purchase another just to use on my cats, but for now I'm using mine for dreads -those of you who are looking for a good dread comb, I've used this on human, and synthetic hair with equally excellent results.

Once I finish with the micro needle, I apply hyaluronic acid, and then roll with the jade roller. It is SO SOOTHING. The roller has two sides- a large end for the planes of your face, and a small end to get in smaller areas like under your eyes. I only use the micro needle roller once a week-usually on Saturday nights. It does make your face a little red, but it goes away by morning. I use the jade roller a couple times a week, especially after stressful days. Just so you know, make sure to sterilize both rollers or you will have major breakouts from spreading bacteria around. I keep alcohol in a small spritzer to use on both before each use. The  packaging was sufficient, and I would feel comfortable giving it as a gift.",

Once you add on the 3-4 that quality control missed, you are now lacking up to 10 curlers. The curlers that should have been trashed have excess material that catches your hair during application and removal so they pull your hair out. Some only have one side messed up so you just have to make sure the messy part is at the bottom. Just order 2 packs so you have enough good quality ones to use. Application is pretty easy, even for someone like me with no hair talent. My hair is hard to keep curl in and these curls lasted 2 days on freshly washed hair with some product.

I had almost enough rollers to use on all of my hair (1-2 more rollers would\u2019ve been perfect). I used the roller as instructed to with partially damp here. I felt like it made my hair slightly staticky which isn\u2019t the norm for me. It definitely gave me curls but I wouldn\u2019t call them natural looking beach curls.<br /><br />The seller/customer service is GREAT! I was responded to quickly when I contacted them about using this item. Overall it\u2019s a decent purchase. If you\u2019re looking for beach waves I wouldn\u2019t recommend this item but if you\u2019re looking for curls that are made without using heat, I\u2019d say give this item a try.",

I tried all the colors, they say to only wait about 30 mins in the instructions but online for other products they said about 2 hours so thats what I followed. Then after that you rinse it with soap and water, it literally washed half the black coloring off right off the bat. The picture above is less than 24 hrs after putting them on. One they look like someone just used a marker to draw on you, nothing real looking about it but also just a pain compared to using an actual marker cause you gotta keep the spot from moving to much otherwise the stencil moves and can bleed the design like what happened on the fish as the end of my arm. Overall save your money, atleast henna looks like it's In your skin this doesn't look or act anything like that.",

My blonde one has bangs and it looks like real hair. This one would be fine if I wanted to wear a fabric headband to cover the center part, but I don\u2019t want to always do that.

                "text": "I was able to cut the front folded rubber hairline off of this and make it blend fairly well with having a bit of my natural hair pulled out at the hairline. There is still a visible line because as you know, it's not lace, but a thin piece of rubber simulated scalp, so there's an edge, but on this wig I got lucky that the edge layed flat, so even though there's a line, it's a flat line as opposed to a lifted line which would look much more obvious. I've worn it in public, around my family and no one noticed it's a wig. It passed my test! I did sew wig combs in the sides and back though because the first time I wore it, there was slippage (even though I wore it with a wig grip), but since sewing on the combs, it doesn't budge. The hair itself is really pretty. It does shed quite a bit, but so does my natural hair. I'm used to it. It was fine putting some heat on it, just be careful...not too hot. Of course it tangles after wearing it for a day, but tangles come out just fine as long as you're gentle. The style of the hair is so pretty, and if you don't mind working with it a little (cutting the rubber, plucking the part, adding combs, etc.), it's worth the cost and has the potential to look fairly natural. Sorry about the graininess of the photo due to low lighting. Other photos I took made the wig take on a reddish hue, so I didn't post those here, but it truly is a light/medium brown with darker (not black) roots.",

                "text": "This wig looks really cute, and I was able to get it to mostly blend with my natural gray hair around my face and with my widow's peak, which is pretty hard to blend in with a lot of wigs. I don't like to use any kind of glue or tape, so I depend on a wig grip and bobby pins to hold everything in place. This fit my head pretty well, and I have an average size head, but I think slightly larger heads would fit too. I'm not sure it would do too well if you have really long and thick hair, as it might take up too much space in the cap. When I had it on, I didn't notice the tracks, but when it was off I thought they were pretty noticable, and I was a little worried. Also you know how on some wigs, they add those short annoying hairs that inevitably end up poking through the longer ones and looking weird? Yep, I noticed the hair towards the back of the cap does that. Coincidentally, that's the place where the tracks are most visible as well.<br />The thing I like about it, is the actual hair, and the color, the texture, and the ability to flip it from side to side (even though it's parted in the middle. The style of it is most like my natural hair of any wig that I've purchased so far. I did add some dry shampoo. The color looks really awesome indoors. Outside in the daylight, it is a little much. It looks pretty white outdoors, but has a nice silvery-gray color indoors. So there are some negatives, but I could see wearing this as a daily wear wig. It didn't tangle too badly after a full day of wear... even with me running my fingers through it and flipping it like I do. I was easily able to tidy it up by finger combing at the end of the day. I wish the back side was slightly longer because the front that frames your face is longer and the waves in the back can look a little shaggy compared to the slightly curlier waves in the front. Overall, it's still cute, but I think the price is too much for this short wig. It should be closer to the $20 range. I'd love to own a 22-24\" version of this in the same color or even a slightly darker gray or gray mix.",

It's not too difficult to work with. It really looks like how my hair used to many years ago when I had bangs. The hair is soft and wasn't too shiney. I sprayed a little dry shampoo on it anyway. I think a lot of people could get away with wearing this wig undetected. It could use a clip in the back. It has the standard adjustable straps, but a clip would just add that lil bit of extra security. I might add one. They're cheap enough, and could I see myself wearing this one daily, so I definitely want it secure. Overall, I love it.",

The only reason I won\u2019t give it 5 stars is because after a few uses, like the consistent action of lathering up the soap and then wringing it out, the braids begin to loosen and it almost looks like all it\u2019s feathers are plucked and disheveled lol (if that makes sense, use your imagination).

Like something that will help suction some of the glitters up and help splatter or drop etc onto nails. I love these, like I said, but I have yet to use them on nails I make with foil nail transfers because the couple times I have tried pinching the glitters and putting it on the nail.. it either comes out in a giant chunk or it doesn't land on the nail at all.

Later we tried again this time I decided to use some frizz treatment and that worked even better yet again beautiful curles! She encouraged me to buy another so we can all use it at the same time!

I also just used this to start dreads on our son and omg what a difference after the product absorbed his hair is so nice and his biracial hair which is very soft and coily is sticking together nice after backcombing and palm rolling. Last time we did with the white version and it was too heavy and didn't absorb properly left his hair sticky and wanted out first wash. I will stick with this every time for both my guys.",

I like the scent and whish it was a bit stronger. This is not a deodorant soap, so it does not leave a scent on the skin after drying off. Though it does clean very well and rinses off with ease. There is no after slime or weird tacky feeling. The soap does have beads in it, so if you are a hands and soap person, you will like that.<br /><br />The scent is difficult to describe so I won't try..<br /><br />This stuff will last a long time as it takes very little, for medium water, not hard or soft water, just in the middle, to lather and clean.",

The big brush is excellent at detangling, and the rest of them are excellent at their various specific jobs. Sure, they're a bit flimsier than other brush sets, with thinner, cheaper plastic, but I've used worse, and they're not bad enough to bend under normal pressure or fall apart. They're meant to be inexpensive brushes, and that's whattl they do well. I recommend if you need an extra brush set. If you want a really long-term, more permanent set, probably look for others, but these should still last a good while.",

I rarely use the tail comb and instead prefer the round and paddle brushes, which are both excellent. These work great on both thick and long hair, and my partner had no trouble with them. The brushes are well-packaged and are simple to use due to their small weight. Furthermore, a single brush might now cost around $5 at the pharmacy. Having said that, this collection represents excellent value. For style, I also enjoy the pointed comb. The brush cleaning tool, like the rest of the kit, is made of cheap plastic, yet it is pure brilliance.",

I've been using 1 for several weeks now with no signs of ripping. The twin elastic strands are appropriate for all hair types. A jumbled bund is simple to make using the two strands. Furthermore, the multiple strands make the ties incredibly strong, so you don't have to wrap it around your hair too many times. I can knot one strand of hair and then do something else with the other strand without losing control of my hands. Excellent idea, and it's incredibly adaptable. The bonds are quite strong.",

But that is what makes this set half the price of a normal set at the store and much more lightweight that some of them. I mean $11 is the price for like two brushes at the store these days.

Replacement  arrived today with same ear issue PLUS deformed ear.  The skin finish is perfect on the replacement.<br /><br />It\u2019s a beautiful mannequin and perfect size.  The price is good for how beautiful it is but it seems that the defective issue is a recurring theme. I\u2019m sad not giving it five stars but I want to be honest in my review to inform others of the potential issues. If you don\u2019t need it for earrings display, buy it!

I have literally probably tried everything on the market. Even after a professional \u201cluxury\u201d pedicure, 2 days later, my feet are cracking again!!! But let me tell you!!!! THIS WORKS!!! Not only did it smooth my rough heels out... they stay that way!!!! The first time I used it, I didn\u2019t have to do it again for at least 2 weeks!!!! It was very easy to use, and only took about 5 minutes of scrubbing to do both feet!!! And, to top it all off, it made them soft too!!! This is not your average pumice stone!!! This little gem only costs $5 bucks too!!! Wish I woulda known about this years ago bc it\u2019s literally all you need!!!",

Sure, it\u2019s cleaner than actual sand but I\u2019m not sure how you can put \u201cno mess\u201d on the packaging in good conscience. It\u2019s impossible to sweep it, use a wet wipe, or even pick up with your hands since it compacts when you touch it. We had to use the vaccum and then wash the toys we were playing in it with. I might only recommend this if you\u2019re gonna play with it in the bath tub, then you can just spray your kid down when they\u2019re done. It would also make a great revenge gift :)",

                "text": "first the elephant in the room - read the ingredients and you will see there is formaldehyde.  technically this is terrible but it is somewhat manageable.  be in a ventilated space.  personally i turn the bathroom fan on while i am using it for the whole process - especially during the flat iron part.  i also turn on a regular floor fan pointed into the bathroom, whatever i can do to keep the air moving.<br /><br />ok - now that we have covered that - the actual product.  it's sooooo easy to use.  the process is so simple and easy.  the directions are super easy to understand and follow and there are pictures included.  it's pretty quick - you can get through it all within an hour once you get started on the actual product.  just follow the directions.<br /><br />then for maintenance between treatments there is a shampoo and conditioner provided.  these are EXTREMELY thick!  like the conditioner is so crazy thick it's almost too difficult to get it out of the bottle.  it's a workout.  but it's all good to help maintain though.<br /><br />now - the results.  i'm not disappointed at all.  i know it's working.  it's not a crazy perma-straight situation though.  this is NOT salon results.  let me repeat that ... NOT salon results.  i have super natural curly hair - i can still wash my hair curly.  the same amount of curls as i have always had.  when i do wear it curly though, i also still have the same amount of frizz.  it's sad and true.  that said though - it's when wear it straight that the product shows it's worth!  the picture i have posted it right after coming after getting caught in the rain.  in the past my hair would just revert back to the full on curl, no waves just the game of 'how big is my hair gonna grow?' watch party.  this time though ... i ended up with a style that i actually like!  something i could easily still get away with wearing for the rest of the day/evening.  as rainy and muggy as it has been lately - i can dig this and appreciate it through and through.<br /><br />so all that said - do i wish it did a bit more for the curly hair frizz ... yes.  but for the price and the fact that i will probably get 4 treatments out of this set - i think the system is worth for the investment - cost and time.",

The 3 hair bundle was well packaged in a pink pouch with 2 gifts(cute hair ruffle). The hair had no smell, I was not allergic to it which I really like. It looks classy. Good quality for the price. My hairdresser stated that the hair weft was easy to sew into my hair. As for the the number of bundles, it was enough for me as I have very small scalp. The hair is very soft with very minimal to no shedding when brushed with a good brush. This particular bundle did not come with hair closure. I curled and trimmed mine a little and it turned out really well as it gave it a fuller look. I\u2019ve washed the hair once in  the shower with lukewarm  water, applied good shampoo and conditioner and it came out really nice. Will highly recommend.",

Its just straight little pieces of short plastic. It works though and I always inspect my brush for hair loss. Some how some way this works perfect with very little hair loss. And my hair dries great after using this. Look in all honesty I have no idea how it works so well. But I am real glad I found it. No tangles , no getting hair pulled out and fabulous looking hair drying naturally ! And I have $30 plus brushes that don't come close to this inexpensive jewel !  Wish everything was like that !

                "text": "I got these for my wife and she enjoys using them. They are a little stiff right out of the package, but if you wash them before using they soften up quite a bit. She said they are absorbent enough to use with liquids like foundation, but do not do quite as well with the powders. However washing the sponges to soften them helps the powder stay on them better. They are smaller than a lot of other make up sponge brands so they are convenient for travel and take up less space when packing. After a while the foundation stops washing out, but because of the durable materials she is getting about double the amount of uses she gets with other sponges.",

The stencils were way to big for her face, and did not match the shape of her brows at all. The kit is messy to use, and pretty tough to wash off once applied. She plans on using the individual items in the future, but as a kit this did not meet expectations.",

Do yourself and the children a favor and get it.  The difference is like night and day, save your wrists and all involved the tears.  I find this brush to be nice and sturdy.  If you have issues with your hands/ wrist ( arthritis/carpal tunnel, etc) and gripping it works well, but may be a challenge weight-wise. I highly recommend you try it.  The price is reasonable for two, and shipping is fast too.",

                "text": "So I bought these lip balm containers about a year ago and because of either laziness or trepidation (really it was the latter) it took me this long to create a label for them. I used canva to create the label, printed it on vinyl sticker paper and a cricut machine to cut it once it was printed. It sounds easy peezy right? No! The SIZE of the tube was the problem! No matter how many you tube videos I watched nobody had this size tube and I went through I don't know how many pages (plain paper, mind you) printing out a sample until I got the measurements right. So for those of you who want to do the same (yes I am selling lip balm and needed a label for retail) the correct measurement is 1.6x2.0... the height will give you just enough room to clear both the top and the turn circle (or whatever its called) at the bottom. The width however is just shy of touching. you can even expand it to 2.1 if you want your label to overlap.<br />Overall I like the tubes, I haven't had any problem with them other than the fact that they are truly small, but they're sturdy and have very little leakage, they are a good deal for the price.<br />But remember, if you're selling your lip balms or just want to pretty it up with a label, the measurements are 1.6x2.0.<br />Enjoy!",

I must have seen the Lume ad at least that many times before I finally broke down and bought it.  Two aspects of their claim really intrigued me.  First of all, they said you could use it on any part of your body, not just armpits.  Second, they said it fights odor for 72 hours.  I had to try this stuff!  I wish it cost a little lest, but after buying, I have become hooked.  I don't think I'll ever go back to other deodorants again!  I have tried most of the scents, and have several tubes in the bathroom right now.  My shoes no longer stink, but now smell like the delicate scent of Lume.  All day long, I smell like Lume, rather than BO--all over my body.  I have not put it to the 72 hour test.  I can't bring myself to go that long, but it definitely works for 24 hours.  I wake up the next morning with some sweat, but no stench or BO.",

It genuinely smells awful and I will be returning it.<br /><br />**UPDATE 09/22/21** I now know what the smell reminds me of. Most modern parents know what a diaper genie is and what it smells like after it has been used for a while. Well, that's the scent I got with the bay rum Lume deodorant.

The price point is really ridiculous for the quality. Don't waste your dollars.<br /><br />Power: Lasts the day for me (as in from morning to night, not 24 hours) -- note that I am not very sweaty person and do not have a bad issue with body odor, so it isn't that impressive. So, it is better than some of the other natural deodorants for sure, but it is not magic or super powerful and I cannot imagine that it would last someone 48 or 72 hours. I only used it on pits so that is what I am referring to.<br /><br />Scent: The scent is where this loses a lot of points for me. It just does not smell good. It is not so bad that I will not continue to use it up, but it is a definite down side.<br /><br />Consistency: This comes in a traditional deodorant dispenser, yet it is a cream that pops up through three holes. You have no choice but to rub it in like lotion, and the amount that comes out of the 3 holes all at once is too much. I only need 2 because I only use it for pits only. As far as putting it on, it does rub right in and then it does not feel like you have anything on you. Not any annoying sensation on the skin.<br /><br />Overall impression: Would maybe buy again in another scent if the price were 1/2 what it is. It is just not special enough to pay this much for it again. Also, I think the applicator is pointless and it should simply be in the lotion tube, especially if they want to advertise right on the package that it can be used on other parts of the body. It seems unsanitary the idea of rolling this traditional deodorant applicator on your foot then popping it onto your armpit. Again, this scent is disappointing and I would not want to buy it again. It does provide me with 1 day's worth of coverage.",

The stick deoderant comes out as a cream so you get way too much at one time, and the hard plastic of the applicator was unpleasant.<br />2.) The product stays wet on your skin no matter where you apply. I tried it for 7 days in a row to get an honest impression. My armpits were left slippery and wet after every application until I washed it off. I experimented with losing less of the Lume and I got similiar results regardless of how much I put on.<br />3.) The scents that I got were very old-lady smelling and once I got to really moving the scent mixed with my natural body odor actually left me smelling worse.",

I normally buy from Lumes website but they are insanely slow to ship and they're headquartered in my city. I needed this yesterday so I had to buy on Amazon. My 14yo son is stinky. I believe this to be true for most teenage boys. However this stuff solved that problem. Because it works for extra hours, it helps the forgetful kids. I haven't gagged at the smell of my son since we found this stuff. Buy this, lots of it, if you have stinky boys.<br />Second, let's talk big boobs: I've got 'em. It's super hard to keep the under boob area dry & chafing free in 100\u00b0 summers. This does not stop sweat - but it does stop the smell & most importantly the red chafing that goes along with it. I have very sensitive skin & have tried 'all the things' to cure my constant red, chafing & sometimes yeast infected under boobs - including Dr prescribed ointments. This did it when nothing else does.<br />I will admit this stuff is ridiculously expensive. It doesn't smell pretty. The shipping is slow direct from them. They've messed up 2 of my orders (not Amazon) But for the 2 reasons I stated above (teenagers & underboobs), I will continue to purchase this in all forms & scents.",

Since then finding a replacement deodorant has been my biggest challenge. I have a graveyard of expensive deodorants and homemade  concoctions. They either caused painful irritation from the baking soda or gave no body odor coverage. I first ordered L\u00fame about 3 years ago and I haven\u2019t looked back. Jasmine Rose is my favorite scent but they are all great. I have done HIIT workouts and survived to hot humid Alabama heat with still no stinky smell. It\u2019s important to remember this is a deodorant only, not an antiperspirant. It don\u2019t find that to be an issue for me. I have found that if I shower at night I need to apply the deodorant before going to bed or you will know you haven\u2019t come morning. I reapply after every shower or swimming. Unlike deodorants like secret this deodorant easily washes away, which is a good thing.<br /><br />Some thing to consider when switching from traditional deodorants to natural options. Even with baking soda free options there might be a detoxing period where you may feel some irritation. Especially, if you\u2019ve used most name brands for years. I did not have this problem with L\u00fame, but that doesn\u2019t mean someone else won\u2019t. If irritation or rash happens there are some natural detoxes you can apply to help speed up the process.",

I developed a rash reaction to aluminum deodorants when I was 17 (28 now) and where I liked the old spice smell it did not last throughout the day. LUME isn\u2019t perfect and I don\u2019t think Is 72hr worthy but for a whole day it does the best job for any natural deodorant I\u2019ve ever used. Looking at these reviews I wonder if they got bad product from sitting in Amazon warehouses or from another seller. Mine never looked like gray goop or caused a rash. I\u2019ve never bought it on here. L\u00fbmes site is cheaper too if you just do the 2 pack with a subscription.",

I didn't have any particular physical needs with regard to sweating, and just wanted to maintain that \"shower fresh\" feeling throughout the day. My deodorant and feminine spray wasn't accomplishing this. So, I purchased the unscented roller. Honestly, it worked okay to get me through much of my day, but the smell was so unbearable, I couldn't stand to use it after showering. After a couple of weeks, I had to abandon it. I kept trying to figure out what the smell resembled and reminded me of? I finally realized that I used to be bothered by deer eating all my flowers at my home due to my proximity to the forest. To keep them at bay, I used a spray on the plants that was a deterrent. It kept them away from the blooms and worked wonderfully. However, the smell was unbearable. I learned to spray it late at night to spare my neighbors. Then it dawned on me...that's what this deodorant smells like! I just couldn't tolerate it. I threw it out.  A waste for me. I hope you have better luck!",

There\u2019s no \u201cstinky phase\u201d with Lum\u0113. I\u2019m honestly in disbelief. I wanted to give it about a week before leaving a product review. I do yoga every morning and have been hot in summer commuting. I\u2019m amazed that it keeps me feeling dry and there\u2019s no BO smell. Up to this point I had been using Dove. The scent of this is very mild, which I prefer, in fact once it\u2019s been on you really can\u2019t smell anything. I only apply it after my nightly shower and just the smallest amount (this is important). You also need to let it completely dry before touching it to any clothing to prevent marking, but I haven\u2019t noticed dark staining that other reviews mention, and I have put it on while wearing a white tank. Again, use the smallest amount, that\u2019s all you need.",

Note to future self... smell first put on second.<br />Here is the smell:<br />Many many years ago I went on a multiple-day mission in Afghanistan.  There were no showers.  On the last night, I crawled into my sleeping bag and tucked in.  I enjoy my nose in to keep it warm.  But not on this night. I took one whiff of my unbathed body and gagged, immediately sticking my nose out of the bag of old sour body odor.  This is the smell of this deodorant.<br />I didn't buy deodorant to make myself smell like I just returned from a hot sticky long mission.  I wanted something a bit less body odor and a bit more pleasant.<br />I would discourage anyone with the ability to still smell to avoid this stuff.",

                "text": "I\u2019ve been a Lum\u00e9 user since Spring of 2020. I like the deodorant because most \u201cnatural\u201d deodorants really irritate my sensitive skin where it\u2019s unbearable and anything that\u2019s aluminum based destroys my underarms. The formula of this is nice, I don\u2019t find it to clump in my underarm hair like other deodorants do. It goes on smooth and seems to absorb into my arm pits nicely.<br /><br />Alright so here\u2019s the reasons I scored Lum\u00e9 Bay Rum so poorly:<br /><br />I\u2019ve been continuously disappointed because any scent that I like, they end up discontinuing. \ud83d\ude2d First it was Blue Spruce or Juniper something that then morphed into Juniper Breeze and then that just disappeared.<br /><br />I was in a bind in June and Bay Rum was the fastest scent that could ship so I tried that one. I figured since it was so popular and has been around for a long time, that this scent was going to be incredible! My expectations were clearly set too high because WOW this stuff STANKS! It smelled like rotten eggs. I know I have an aversion to rum after a bad night at my friends wedding in 2015 but I thought I could put that in the past for the sake of my underarms. Unfortunately, this stuff really stunk and doesn\u2019t even smell like rum anything! Not even rum raisin ice cream or malibu or a beautiful fresh bay!<br /><br />One thing I\u2019ve noticed since buying Lum\u00e9 from Amazon is that the consistency of each deodorant is never the same. Sometimes it\u2019s an oozing, soupy mess, other times it\u2019s a light fluffy consistency that\u2019s just perfect, then it also can come out like a gritty, frosting that struggled to exit the 3 little holes on the deodorant stick.<br /><br />I\u2019m a big guy and I sweat a lot and there\u2019s a lot of space to cover on my underarms, so I never have been confident in Lum\u00e9\u2019s 72-hour claim however I\u2019ve had success with about 24 hours (not with Bay Rum though). Right now I\u2019m using Tangerine and it\u2019s nice and lasts for a little bit\u2026 definitely not as long as the OG scents they discontinued, but I can make it through most of the summer day without smelling like a disgusting heap of trash!<br /><br />Some of the other scents don\u2019t last that long on me, but when I put rotten egg smelling Bay Rum on me I really don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m covered at all. I used this for a bit of June and had to throw it out because I couldn\u2019t even go a few hours without smelling stinky.  As a fat person, I\u2019m very aware of my size, my personal hygiene and of course how I smell.<br /><br />Anyways, stay away from this gross scent - maybe I got a bad batch of it, but I\u2019m just scratching my head at how Amazon says this is the most popular scent. Maybe they\u2019re all just trying to sell off this disgusting batch.<br /><br />BRING BACK JUNIPER BREEZE!",

This was not a, \"Oh, time for a shower, starting to get a bit odiferous.\" This was a, \"OMG DO YOU STINK!\" It literally smelled like someone living in a dumpster for several weeks.<br />  But I thought, when it stops working, it STOPS working. Good to know. But then the same exact scent emanated from the groin area. Ladies' pits and groins do not create the same chemical reaction/odors. This was not a lack of odor protection, this is creating the odor.<br />  It could very well just be my body chemistry, but this one does NOT work for me.",

It does last 72 hours as well and the smell, well it is really nice and not overpowering.

Now, granted I have barely any eyebrows due to hypothyroidism, so finding something that looks natural is key.  I love this little kit.  It comes in a very handy little plastic zip lock bag which includes, the brow powder, 24 eyebrow stencils, and 4 eyebrow/eyelash brushes.  It was a bit difficult sorting through all 24 stencils but I narrowed it down to 4 initially, then down from there to 3, then 2, then 1.  On my right eyebrow(your left in the 4th pic), I did my eyebrow with the standard eyebrow pencil how I usually shape it.  I thought by doing one to compare to, it might make it easier to find the closest shape to what I do.  After finally selecting the stencil I was going to use, it was easy to peel it off the paper and apply to my skin/eyebrow.  I may have stretched it a little, I am not sure.  The brow powder applicator doesn't twist or push up.  It just has powder in the tip automatically.  Oh, I forgot to mention that on the back of the stencil box, there are instructions.  So, I kind of dabbed the brow powder on, but I do think it helps if you have eyebrow hairs for it to cling to in the first place!  I do at the start, but my ends are gone!  The brow powder is a bit loose and a small amount fell over the sink.  I then peeled the stencil off(was easy and didn't hurt).  I show the immediate results in pic 7.  In my opinion, it was a bit thick(I'm more \"old school\" and like my eyebrows thin), so I took a wet tissue and wiped a bit away and made it more narrow.  I also used one of the eyebrow/eyelash brushes to feather it out a little.  Then my final results are in pic 8.  I would say NOT BAD.  From far away it does look more natural than the pencil shaped one which is thinner and more precise.  Natural brows are not like that!  I will say though, it is not exactly \"water proof\".  Sure, if some raindrops got on it, it wouldn't immediately take it off, but it was easy to remove with a wet tissue and soap.  I think with both brows the same, I could get used to using this kit.  I am not sure how long the brow powder will last in the tube, but having the eyebrow stencils is handy and quick.  For the price, I would definitely recommend it!",

Overall, wanted to love, but feeling so-so with product thus far. Going to try again with white paint. There\u2019s also a strong odor.<br /><br />After doing with white base it looks better. The gel lightens up. It\u2019s difficult to make even. It\u2019s pretty!<br /><br />Not sure if the cracked container was a one off situation or not because no other reviews. If you\u2019re up for a challenge, go for it!<br /><br />One nail, with one coat of flowers, took 2 min 30 seconds under UV gel to set (my typical polish takes 60 seconds.",

Then I would add the color I wanted and it seem the nail polish would bleed or mix in to the black. It worked on 4 of my nails but the other not so well. They chipped and then it seemed like they didn't dry in certain spots on my nails so it bubbled and peeled.

The bristles were made from boars\u2019 hair and the handle from bamboo. Nylon bristles came about around 1938. Today, some toothbrushes still use boar\u2019s bristles, however, some say there are concerns about the action of the natural bristles on the enamel and gums, so many still recommend soft nylon bristles. Here, we have a natural bamboo handle, which is sturdy and durable, with little to no bend and very smooth, so someone took time to sand this down. The bristles are very soft. Which is easy on the gums and enamel. The toothbrush head and handle are perfect for a little one\u2019s mouth, allowing access to those small to reach places. Practicing good oral hygiene is so important, at a young age. Our little one found this toothbrush perfect in size to maneuver about and the bristles comfortable. We see no shedding of a single bristle at this early stage; and plan to rotate this out of commission, after its effectiveness appears of concern, after a bad cold, or just after so many months of service. With that in mind, cost is always a concern. These are no bargain basement toothbrushes. They are a premium product in our opinion and are priced accordingly.  Bamboo toothbrush handles can be composted, used as kindling, and can be repurposed for other household uses. However, just like plastic toothbrush handles, they will take up space in a landfill if just thrown away. We reconsidered using plastic toothbrushes, and now choose bamboo toothbrushes as an alternative to the plastic, which ends up in landfills. Plastic is not designed to break down and plastic toothbrushes are difficult to recycle. We decided bamboo to be an excellent alternative to reduce plastic waste at home. Finally, our little one gave this bamboo toothbrush, with its cute design laser burned into the handle two (2) thumbs up for fit, having that fun handle design, unique style, soft bristle comfort, lack of odor, and ease of using. We agree.",

They go to great lengths to ensure both of these elements are integrated into their wonderful product. With that said, the cost is very fair and less expensive than some of the other makers of castille bar soap...and I also love that the soap lasts awhile and doesn't disintegrate fast when wet. (They also have wonderful natural beeswax candles!)<br /><br />Original: I recently have tried to go more natural with products my family uses. This soap was an unexpected delight. Although a bit pricey, I do enjoy both the calming light scent as well as the bit of texture that the soap has. It acts as an exfoliate. The bar sizes are not large but easy to hold and don't slip out of my hand like others do. I also like the companies structure and desire to help others!",

So I had to try another texture from them. This time I ordered the wavy hair 3 bundles of 24 inch from their Amazon page. After purchasing from here I received an email from the seller asking what pattern of wavy I would like and showed pictures of the different textures. I chose Deep wave which is there waviest wave. My hair arrived to Houston Texas in 3 days (I don\u2019t have prime). The hair was just as amazing as the curly hair that I ordered from this company last year (which I still wear and looks just as it did when I initially purchased). I also included a photo of the curly hair (it\u2019s the armpit length hair and I have one a white top).<br /><br />HAIR SPECS<br />3 bundles of Deep wavy. This wavy hair is true raw hair so it is FULL even when ordering long lengths. You only need 3 bundles! Also the hair is truly 24 inches and even slightly longer. I have received virtually no shedding or tangling.<br /><br />MAINTANACE<br />I put this hair in a very loose bun (pineapple) on the very top of my head. Then I wrap a scarf around to prevent frizzing when sleeping. I never wet the hair or \u201crefresh\u201d in between washes. I simple wash and condition the hair once a week and let it air dry. No leave in products used.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br />I love this company and will continue to purchase from them as long as they sell high quality raw hair. Highly recommend to anyone who does not like Chinese made blend hair commonly sold nowadays.",

They're awesome because it's like spreading the base of a pony tale from the top to the bottom of your head giving a pony mane effect. They're perfect for curly hair.<br /><br />I'm fifty, if you used to wear them like me you'll remember there were two sizes. These are the longer size. It was funny that when I opened the package I immediately looked for which end had the wide piece and which had the little ball hinge. These are crappy cheap versions of what I remember. They're very difficult to open. I filed down the little nub on the opening end with a nail file and that helped. Having said that, I love them!<br /><br />I've been working from home during lockdown for a year and usually have a scrunchie on top my head or a butterfly clip in the back. My new banana clip is so much more comfortable. I will be wearing one in my Zoom meeting tomorrow.",

I researched ways to stop the chafing and this came up along with some other cheaper ways. This little roll on stick worked to stop all chafing!  My kids would roll this all over their legs and anywhere they\u2019d normally chafe at the beach, then go out for the day. I have 4 kids and it lasted about two/three days. My only complaint, the bottle doesn\u2019t hold enough. We used Aquaphor after it was out, and it worked too, but is very messy and not easy to apply.",

However sometimes I want to walk on the beach when I haven't planned ahead and have on my swimsuit or shorter shorts. I kept this in my bag and just rolled it on. It's a little greasy feeling at first but not noticeable at all once I am moving around.",

My son, who is 3, would always be rubbed raw under his bathing suit every time he went swimming. We tried new baiting suits, underwear, swim diapers and nothing helped. We recently went to the beach for a weekend and I knew I needed to find something to put on him to keep him from being chaffed or else it would be a miserable trip. So I found this product on Amazon and it was amazing! My son never had any issues after full days at the beach and the pool! 10/10 would recommend!",
